Valentin is raising pigs and geese on his farm. One day, he counts the total number of legs as being 100 (not including himself). He then goes to the market and sells some pigs and then uses some of the money he just made to buy geese. He comes back and adds them to the farm; to his surprise, there are still 100 legs on his farm. If a pig sells for 5 dollars and you can buy a goose for 2 dollars, and he made 10 dollars, how many pigs did he sell?
