For a positive integer $n\geq 2$, consider the $n-1$ fractions 
\begin{align*}
    \frac{2}{1}, \frac{3}{2}, \ldots , \frac{n}{n-1}.
\end{align*}  
The product of these fractions is initially equal to $n$, but if you inverse (i.e. switch the numerator and denominator of) some of the fractions, the value of the product will change. Find all $n$ for which you can make the value equal 1.
