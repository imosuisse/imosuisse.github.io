Find all pairs of positive real numbers $a\leq b$ such that the following holds:

There exists a set $S$ of points in the plane such that, for every finite collection of orthogonal rectangles with dimensions $a\times b$ or $b\times a$, every rectangle contains exactly one point from $S$.

\emph{Remark: Orthogonal means that all sides are parallel to either the $x-$ or the $y-$axis.}
