<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(17\)</span> rooks on an
ordinary chessboard. Show that you can always choose three rooks, none
of which threaten each other.</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> A rook can move any number of squares to the left,
right, up or down in one move. A rook threatens another rook if it can
move to the square of the other rook in one move.</p>
