<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(17\)</span> rooks on an
ordinary chessboard. Show that you can always choose three rooks, none
of which threaten each other. <em>Remark:</em> A rook can move any
number of squares to the left, right, up or down in one move. A rook
threatens another rook if it can move to the square of the other rook in
one move.</p>
