<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. We
consider an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> grid. We
colour <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> squares in black, such
that given any three columns, there exists at most one row that
intersects the three columns at a black square. Prove that <span
class="math display">\[\frac{2k}{n} \leq \sqrt{8n-7}+1.\]</span></p>
