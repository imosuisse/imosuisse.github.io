<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span> be the set of all
primes and let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a subset of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span>, having at least three
elements, and such that the following property is satisfied: For any
positive integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and for any
subset <span class="math inline">\(A=\{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k\}\)</span>
of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(A\neq M\)</span>, all of the prime factors of the
number <span class="math inline">\(p_1\cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k -
1\)</span> are contained in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.
Prove that <span class="math inline">\(M=\mathbb{P}\)</span>.</p>
