<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> be positive integers with <span
class="math inline">\(r &lt; n\)</span>. Mickey has <span
class="math inline">\(kn + r\)</span> black socks and <span
class="math inline">\(kn + r\)</span> white socks. He wants to hang them
on a straight clothesline in such a way that there are no <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> consecutive socks of which <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of them are black and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of them are white. Show that he can do
this if and only if <span class="math inline">\(r \geq k\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(n &gt; k + r\)</span> holds.</p>
