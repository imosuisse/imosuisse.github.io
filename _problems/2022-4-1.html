<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer.
Prove that there exists a finite sequence <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> consisting of only zeros and ones,
satisfying the following property: For any positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(d\geq 2\)</span>, when <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is interpreted as a number in base
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, the resulting number is non-zero
and divisible by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> The sequence <span class="math inline">\(S =
s_ks_{k-1}\cdots s_1s_0\)</span> interpreted in base <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the number <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{i = 0}^k s_id^i\)</span>.</p>
