<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 5\)</span> be an integer.
Determine the largest integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
such that a polygon with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices
and exactly <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> interior <span
class="math inline">\(90^\circ\)</span> angles exists?</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> The polygon does not have to be convex, but the edge
must not intersect itself.</p>
