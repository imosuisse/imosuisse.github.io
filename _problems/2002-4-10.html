<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> be an arbitrary positive
integer. As a function of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>,
determine the smallest natural number <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for which the following applies: If
<span class="math inline">\(\{m, m+1, \ldots , k\} = A \cup B\)</span>
is any decomposition into two sets <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> contains three elements <span
class="math inline">\(a, b, c\)</span> (which do not necessarily have to
be distinct) with <span class="math inline">\(a^{b} = c\)</span>.</p>
