<p>Consider a <span class="math inline">\(7 \times 7\)</span> field that
is divided into <span class="math inline">\(49\)</span> unit squares. We
want to place tiles in the shape of a Swiss cross, consisting of <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> unit squares, in this field. The
borders of the crosses should lie on the lines of the field. Determine
the smallest possible number of squares that must be marked on the field
so that each cross, no matter where it is placed on the field, covers at
least one marked square.</p>
