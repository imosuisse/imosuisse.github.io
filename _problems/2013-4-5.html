<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be a set with <span
class="math inline">\(n\geq 1\)</span> elements and let <span
class="math inline">\(A_1,\dots,A_k\)</span> be pairwise different
subsets of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Either two of these
subsets are disjoint or one contains the other. Determine the largest
possible value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
