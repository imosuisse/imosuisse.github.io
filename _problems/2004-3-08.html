following operation is now performed repeatedly: Select any two numbers
<span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span>, wipe them out and write <span
class="math inline">\(\gcd(a,b)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)\)</span> in their place.
Show that the content of the list remains constant after a certain point
in time.</p>
