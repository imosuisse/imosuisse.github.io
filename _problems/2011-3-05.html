<p>The tangents in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to the circumcircle of the triangle
<span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> intersect at point <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The circle through the points <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> again at <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CT\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(BE\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Assume that <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the midpoint of <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>. Calculate the ratio <span
class="math inline">\(BF:FE\)</span>.</p>
