<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a natural integer and
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be the set of points <span
class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> in the plane such that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are integers with <span
class="math inline">\(1\leq x,y\leq n\)</span>. A subset of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is called <em>parallelogramfree</em> if
it does not contain four non-collinear points that are the vertices of a
parallelogram. How many points at most can a parallelogramfree subset
contain?</p>
