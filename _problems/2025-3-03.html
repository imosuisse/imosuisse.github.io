<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. A
group of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> penguins swim in <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> races, in each of which they are ranked
from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>st to <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th position with no draws. A penguin is
eligible for a rating <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> for
positive integers <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, if in at least <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> races they finished in any of the first
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> positions. Their final score is
the maximum possible value <span class="math inline">\(a-b\)</span>
across all ratings for which they are eligible. Find the maximum
possible sum of all scores of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
penguins.</p>
