<p><em>Snipping</em> a convex <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gon
means the following: You select two neighbouring sides <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> and replace them by the lines <span
class="math inline">\(AM, MN, NC\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(M \in AB\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N \in BC\)</span> are arbitrary points inside
these lines. In other words, you cut off a corner and get a <span
class="math inline">\((n\!+\!1)\)</span>-gon.<br />
Starting from a regular hexagon <span class="math inline">\(P_6\)</span>
with area <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, a sequence <span
class="math inline">\(P_6, P_7, P_8,\ldots\)</span> of convex polygons
is generated by continuous snipping. Show that the area of <span
class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span> is greater than <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(n\geq 6\)</span>, regardless of how the polygons
are snipped.</p>
