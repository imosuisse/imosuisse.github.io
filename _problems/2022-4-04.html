<p>Given a (simple) graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span> vertices <span
class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m\geq 1\)</span> edges, Joël and Robert play the
following game with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> coins:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Joël first assigns to each vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> a non-negative integer <span
class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(w_1 + \dots + w_n = m\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Robert then chooses a (possibly empty) subset of edges, and for
each edge chosen he places a coin on exactly one of its two endpoints,
and then removes that edge from the graph. When he is done, the amount
of coins on each vertex <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> should
not be greater than <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joël then does the same for all the remaining edges.</p></li>
<li><p>Joël wins if the number of coins on each vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> is equal to <span
class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Determine all graphs <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> for which
Joël has a winning strategy.</p>
