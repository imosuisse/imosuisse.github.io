<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span> be a positive
integer. Let a regular <span class="math inline">\(4n\)</span>-gon of
side length <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> be arbitrarily
divided into finitely many parallelograms.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prove that at least one of the parallelograms in the
decomposition is a rectangle.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the sum of the areas of all rectangles in the
decomposition.</p></li>
