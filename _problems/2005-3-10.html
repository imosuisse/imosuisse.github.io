<p>Teams of <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;10\)</span> take part in a
football tournament. Each team plays against every other team exactly
once. A win results in two points, a draw in one point and a loss in no
points. After the tournament, it turns out that each team has won
exactly half of its points in the games against the <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> worst teams (in particular, each of
these <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> teams has scored half of
its points against the <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> remaining
teams). Determine all possible values of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and give an example of such a
tournament for these values.</p>
