<p>The village of Roche has <span class="math inline">\(2020\)</span>
residents. One day, the famous mathematician Georges de Rham makes the
following observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every villager knows someone else with the same age as
them.</p></li>
<li><p>For any group of <span class="math inline">\(192\)</span> people
in the village, there are always at least three of them that have the
same age.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Prove that there must exist a group of <span
class="math inline">\(22\)</span> villagers that all have the same
age.</p>
