<p>A mayor and a bounty hunter are at different points in a square whose
sides are made of mirrors. The bounty hunter has a laser pistol whose
beam is reflected by the mirrors and wants to hit the mayor with it. The
laser pistol only has enough energy for one shot. To protect him, the
mayor can deploy finitely many bodyguards. Bodyguards can stand on the
sides of the square, but not in places that are already occupied by the
mayor or the bounty hunter. If the laser beam hits a person, the person
dies and the laser beam is stopped. Can the mayor place his bodyguards
in such a way that the bounty hunter cannot hit him?</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> All persons involved are to be regarded as points
and each person is aware of the positions of the others involved. If the
laser beam goes exactly into a corner, it is reflected back in the
direction from which it came.</p>
