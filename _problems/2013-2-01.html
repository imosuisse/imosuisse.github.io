<p>A group of <span class="math inline">\(2013\)</span> people sit down
at a round table, evenly distributed. After they have sat down, they
notice that there is a name tag at each seat and that no one has sat
down at the seat with their name on it. Show that they can turn the
table so that at least two people have the correct name tag in front of
them.</p>
