<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be a parallelogram such
that <span class="math inline">\(AC=BC\)</span>. A point <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is chosen on the extension of the
segment <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> beyond <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. The circumcircle of the triangle <span
class="math inline">\(ACD\)</span> meets the segment <span
class="math inline">\(PD\)</span> again at <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, and the circumcircle of the triangle
<span class="math inline">\(APQ\)</span> meets the segment <span
class="math inline">\(PC\)</span> again at <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Prove that the lines <span
class="math inline">\(CD\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(AQ\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(BR\)</span> intersect at one point.</p>
