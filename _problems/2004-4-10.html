<p>Consider an acute-angled triangle <span
class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are the feet of the altitudes of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> respectively, and where the orthocenter
is denoted with <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> lie on the segment <span
class="math inline">\(AU\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on the segment <span
class="math inline">\(BV\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> on the segment <span
class="math inline">\(CW\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> are all different from <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(X,Y,Z\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> lie on a circle, if and only if <span
class="math display">\[[ABC] = [ABZ] + [AYC] + [XBC],\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\([PQR]\)</span> denotes the area of the
triangle <span class="math inline">\(PQR\)</span>.</p>
