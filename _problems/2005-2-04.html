<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with <span
class="math inline">\(\angle BAC = 60^\circ\)</span>. Find all points
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in the interior of this triangle
with the following property: If <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>
is the projection of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> onto the
line <span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the projection of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> onto <span
class="math inline">\(CA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the projection of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> onto <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(\angle EDF = 30^\circ\)</span>.</p>
