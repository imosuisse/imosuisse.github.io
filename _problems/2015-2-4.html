<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be an acute triangle and
<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> the intersection of the angle
bisector of <span class="math inline">\(\angle ACB\)</span> and the side
<span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>. Furthermore, let <span
class="math inline">\(I_A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(I_B\)</span> be the incenters of the triangles
<span class="math inline">\(AWC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(WBC\)</span> respectively. The lines <span
class="math inline">\(I_AW\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(I_BB\)</span> intersect at point <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be the midpoint of the line <span
class="math inline">\(DI_B\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(MWBC\)</span> is a cyclic quadrilateral.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The three angle bisectors of a triangle intersect at a
point, the centre of the inscribed circle.</p>
