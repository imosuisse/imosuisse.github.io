<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be a parallelogram.
Assume that there exists a point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>
inside the parallelogram that lies on the perpendicular bisector of
<span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> and such that <span
class="math inline">\(\angle PBA=\angle ADP\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(\angle CPD=2 \,\angle BAP\)</span> holds.</p>
