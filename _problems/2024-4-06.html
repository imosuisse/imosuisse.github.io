<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span> be an integer.
Kaloyan has a <span class="math inline">\(1 \times n^2\)</span> strip of
unit squares, where the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th square
is labelled with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq i \leq n^2\)</span>. He cuts the strip into
several pieces, each piece consisting of a number of consecutive unit
squares. He then places the pieces, without rotation or reflection, on
an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> square such that the
square is covered entirely and the unit square in the <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th row and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th column contains a number congruent
to <span class="math inline">\(i + j\)</span> modulo <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Determine the smallest number of
pieces for which this is possible.</p>
