<p>In the acute triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>, the
point <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the foot of the altitude
from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is a point on the segment <span
class="math inline">\(AF\)</span>. The lines through <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> meet <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> respectively. Points <span
class="math inline">\(X \neq A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y \neq A\)</span> lie on the circumcircles of
triangles <span class="math inline">\(ABD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(ACE\)</span> respectively, such that <span
class="math inline">\(DA=DX\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(EA=EY\)</span>. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(BCXY\)</span> is a cyclic quadrilateral.</p>
