<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. The
islands of the MO-Archipelago are arranged in a regular equilateral
triangular unitary grid to form a big equilateral triangle of side
length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The beloved Governor
Henning is in charge of building bridges between every pair of islands
that are a distance of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> apart. For
every island <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, Henning chooses two
real numbers <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> that satisfy <span
class="math inline">\(x_i^2+y_i^2 = 1\)</span>. The cost of a bridge
between islands <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is then given by <span
class="math inline">\(1+ x_i\, x_j + y_i\, y_j\)</span>. Determine the
minimal amount of money needed to build all the bridges.</p>
