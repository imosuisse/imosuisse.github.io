<p>Given are <span class="math inline">\(6n\)</span> chips in <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> different colours, such that there are
exactly <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> chips of each colour.
These chips are to be distributed into two piles <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> such that both piles contain the same
number of chips and no pile contains three chips of the same colour. How
many ways are there to do this if</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the order of the chips within the stacks does not
matter?</p></li>
<li><p>the order is important?</p></li>
</ol>
