<p>Determine all infinite sequences <span class="math inline">\(a_1,
a_2, \dots\)</span> of positive integers such that, for any integer
<span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span>, both the arithmetic and
geometric mean of any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> consecutive
terms of the sequence are integers.</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> Integers <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\dots, x_k
&gt; 0\)</span> have arithmetic mean <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{x_1+\cdots+x_k}{k}\)</span> and geometric
mean <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt[k]{x_1\cdots x_k}\)</span>.</p>
