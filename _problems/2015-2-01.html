<p>On SMO Street there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> houses
with house numbers <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a positive integer. The houses with
odd numbers are on the left-hand side of the street, the houses with
even numbers on the right. The postman Quirin wants to deliver a
newspaper to each house. How many ways does he have to do this if he
wants to change sides of the street after every newspaper he
delivers?</p>
