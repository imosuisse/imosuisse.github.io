<p>Let points <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> lie on a circle <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> with centre <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> be the circle which is centered at
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and passes through <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Define <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as the second intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and line <span
class="math inline">\(PQ\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as the second intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> be the intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(OX\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(QY\)</span>. Prove that if <span
class="math inline">\(PZYX\)</span> is cyclic, then <span
class="math inline">\(PYX\)</span> is an equilateral triangle.</p>
