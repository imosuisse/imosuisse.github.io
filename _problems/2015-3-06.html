<p>Consider a <span class="math inline">\(8 \times 8\)</span> board. An
<em>inner edge</em> is an edge that separates two <span
class="math inline">\(1 \times 1\)</span> squares. We cut the board into
multiple <span class="math inline">\(1 \times 2\)</span> domino stones.
For an inner edge <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, denote by
<span class="math inline">\(N(k)\)</span> the number of possible ways to
cut the board such that we cut along <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Determine the last digit of the sum we
obtain when adding the <span class="math inline">\(N(k)\)</span> for all
inner edges <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
