<p>A positive integer <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is called
<em>good</em> if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the product
of an even number of (not necessarily different) prime numbers. Let
<span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> be positive integers and define
<span class="math inline">\(m(x)=(x+a)(x+b)\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prove that two different positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> exist such that <span
class="math display">\[m(1),m(2), \ldots, m(2010)\]</span> are all good
numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(m(x)\)</span> is good for every
positive integers <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(a=b\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
