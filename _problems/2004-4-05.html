<p>A <em>block</em> consisting of <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>
unit cubes has the shape of a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2
\times 2\)</span> cube with a missing corner unit cube. An arbitrary
unit cube is removed from a cube of edge length <span
class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n \geq
2\)</span>. Show that the remaining solid can always be constructed from
blocks.</p>
