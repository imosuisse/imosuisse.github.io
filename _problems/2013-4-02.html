<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a polynomial with
integer coefficients such that for all <span class="math inline">\(u,v
\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[u^{2^{2013}}-v^{2^{2013}} \mid
P(u)-P(v).\]</span> Show that there is a polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> with integer coefficients such that
<span class="math inline">\(P(x)=Q(x^{2^{2013}})\)</span> holds.</p>
