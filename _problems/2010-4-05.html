<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a finite set of prime
numbers and let <span class="math inline">\(\ell(P)\)</span> be the
largest possible number of consecutive natural numbers such that each of
these numbers is divisible by at least one prime number from <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Prove the inequality <span
class="math inline">\(\ell(P) \geq |P|\)</span> and show that equality
holds if and only if the smallest element of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is greater than <span
class="math inline">\(|P|\)</span>.</p>
