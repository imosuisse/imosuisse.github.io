<p>The Brazilian IMO leader chooses two positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(n&gt;k\)</span> and shares them with their deputy
and one of their contestants. The leader then whispers a binary sequence
of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to the deputy. The
deputy then writes down all binary sequences of length <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that differ from the shared sequence in
exactly <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> position. The contestant
then looks at all those sequences and tries to guess the sequence the
leader initially chose. How many times does the contestant have to guess
at least, until they are guaranteed to have been correct at least
once.</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> A binary sequence is a sequence consisting of <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>s and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s. Example for <span
class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span>: If the leader chooses <span
class="math inline">\(101\)</span>, the deputy writes down <span
class="math inline">\(001\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(100\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(111\)</span>.</p>
