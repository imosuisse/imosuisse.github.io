<p>Consider a cube with edge length <span
class="math inline">\(2a\)</span>. There is a city at each vertex, the
midpoint of each edge and the midpoint of each face. Two cities are
connected by a road if their distance is <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Is there a route that passes through
each city exactly once?</p>
