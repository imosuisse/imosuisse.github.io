<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;1\)</span> be an odd natural
number. The squares of an <span class="math inline">\(n \times
n\)</span> chessboard are coloured in alternating white and black, such
that the four corner squares are black. An L-triomino is an L-shaped
piece that covers exactly three squares of the board. For which values
of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is it possible to cover all
black squares with L-triominoes such that no two L-triominoes overlap?
Determine the smallest possible number of L-triominos required for these
values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
