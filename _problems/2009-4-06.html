<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be the set of the first
<span class="math inline">\(2009\)</span> prime numbers and let <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the set of all positive integers
that only have prime factors from <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Determine all natural numbers <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for which a function <span
class="math inline">\(f\colon X \rightarrow X\)</span> exists which
fulfils the following equation for all <span class="math inline">\(m,n
\in X\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[f(mf(n))=f(m)n^k.\]</span></p>
