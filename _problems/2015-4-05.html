<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle. The
points <span class="math inline">\(K, L\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> lie on the sides <span
class="math inline">\(BC, CA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> such that the lines <span
class="math inline">\(AK, BL\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CM\)</span> intersect at a point. Show that you
can choose two of the triangles <span class="math inline">\(AML,
BKM\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CLK\)</span> such that the
sum of their incircle radii is at least as large as the incircle radius
of triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>.</p>
