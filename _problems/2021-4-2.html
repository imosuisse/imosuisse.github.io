<p>For each prime <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, somewhere in
the multiverse there exists a kingdom consisting of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> islands numbered from <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with a bridge between any pair of them.
When Jana visits a kingdom, coronavirus restrictions mean she must obey
the following rule: Directly after visiting island <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, she can only cross over to island
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> if <span class="math display">\[p
\div (m^2-n+1)(n^2-m+1).\]</span> Show that there are infinitely many
kingdoms such that Jana cannot travel to every island in this
manner.</p>
