<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be an even positive
integer. We partition the numbers <span
class="math inline">\(1,2,\ldots,n^2\)</span> into two sets <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> with the same size such that all of the
<span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> numbers belong to exactly one
of the two sets. Let <span class="math inline">\(S_A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S_B\)</span> be the sum of all the elements in
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> respectively <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Determine all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that there is a partition with
<span class="math display">\[\frac{S_A}{S_B} =
\frac{39}{64}.\]</span></p>
