<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer and
let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> be prime numbers such that <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
pq &amp;\mid n^p + 2,\\
n + 2 &amp;\mid n^p + q^p.
\end{aligned}\]</span> Show that there are infinitely many positive
integers <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(q \mid 4^m n +2\)</span>.</p>
