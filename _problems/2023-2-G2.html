<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span> be a circle with
diameter <span class="math inline">\(JK\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be the tangent to <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(J\)</span> and let <span class="math inline">\(U
\neq J\)</span> be another point on <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_2\)</span> be the smaller circle centred at
<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> that touches <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span> at one single point <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> be the second intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(JK\)</span> with the circumcircle of triangle
<span class="math inline">\(JYU\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the second intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(KY\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_2\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(FUJI\)</span> is a rectangle.</p>
