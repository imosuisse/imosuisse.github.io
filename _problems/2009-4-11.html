<p>Consider <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> collinear points
<span class="math inline">\(P_1, \ldots, P_n\)</span> and all circles
with diameter <span class="math inline">\(P_iP_j\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n\)</span>. Each of these
circles is coloured with one of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
colours. Such a set of coloured circles is called an <span
class="math inline">\((n,k)\)</span>-<em>cluster</em>. A
<em>monochromatic eight</em> is two circles of the same colour that
touch each other tangentially on the outside. Show that every possible
<span class="math inline">\((n,k)\)</span>-cluster contains a
monochromatic eight if and only if <span
class="math inline">\(n&gt;2^k\)</span> holds.</p>
