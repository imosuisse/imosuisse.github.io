<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span> be a natural
number. There is a watchtower in the centre of a circular garden. At the
edge of the garden are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> evenly
distributed garden gnomes. Attentive guards live on the watchtower. Each
guard monitors an area of the garden that is bordered by two different
garden gnomes. We say that guard <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
controls guard <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> if the entire area
of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is included in that of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. There are two groups of guards:
Apprentices and Masters. Each apprentice is controlled by exactly one
master and does not control anyone, while masters are not controlled by
anyone. The whole garden has maintenance costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An apprentice costs <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> gold
piece per year.</p></li>
<li><p>A master costs <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> gold pieces
per year.</p></li>
<li><p>A garden gnome costs <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> gold
pieces per year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Show that the garden gnomes cost at least as much as the guards.</p>
