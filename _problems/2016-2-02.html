<p>Quirin has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> blocks, with height
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and he wants to place them in a line
in such a way that his cat can go through them from left to right. The
cat can jump from one block to the next one if either the block from
which it jumps is higher, or if the difference in height is at most
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. At the beginning his cat is on
the leftmost block. In how many ways can Quirin place his blocks in such
a line?</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> For <span class="math inline">\(n=5\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(3-4-5-1-2\)</span> is possible, but <span
class="math inline">\(1-3-4-5-2\)</span> is not.</p>
