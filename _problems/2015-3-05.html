<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> be a positive integer. On
the MO blackboard, the number <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is
written <span class="math inline">\(2^m\)</span> times. In a step, one
chooses two numbers <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> on the blackboard and replaces them
each by <span class="math inline">\(a+b\)</span>. Show that after <span
class="math inline">\(m2^{m-1}\)</span> steps the sum of the numbers is
at least <span class="math inline">\(4^m\)</span>.</p>
