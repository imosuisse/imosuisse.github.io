<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(m,n \ge 3\)</span> be integers. Nemo
is given an <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> grid of unit
squares with one chip on every unit square initially. They can
repeatedly carry out the following operation: first, they pick any three
distinct collinear unit squares and then they move one chip from each of
the outer two squares onto the middle square. They may only do this
operation if the outer two squares are not empty, but the middle square
is allowed to be empty. As a function of <span
class="math inline">\((m,n)\)</span>, either determine the maximum
number of operations Nemo can make before they cannot continue anymore,
or prove that they can carry out an arbitrarily large number of
operations.</p>
