<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma_2\)</span> be two circles intersecting at
the points <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> be a line intersecting <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma_1\)</span> at points <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and intersecting <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma_2\)</span> at points <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, such that <span
class="math inline">\(A, B, C, D\)</span> lie on <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> in this order. Let <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be the intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(XA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(YB\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> be the intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(XD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(YC\)</span>.</p>
<p>Prove that <span class="math inline">\(PQ\)</span> is parallel to
<span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>.</p>
