<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> be the midpoints of the circles <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> respectively and call one of their
intersections <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Furthermore, <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> intersects the line <span
class="math inline">\(M_1M_2\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Show that the perpendicular to the
line <span class="math inline">\(M_1M_2\)</span> through the point <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> and the line <span
class="math inline">\(PQ\)</span> intersect at <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span>.</p>
