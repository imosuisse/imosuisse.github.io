<p>Determine all positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with the property that for each divisor
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> there exists a divisor <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x+y\mid n\)</span>. <em>Remark:</em> The divisors
may be negative.</p>
