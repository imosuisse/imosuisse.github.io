<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be a convex
quadrilateral and let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> be points inside the quadrilateral
<span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(PQDA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(QPBC\)</span> are cyclic quadrilaterals. Assume
that a point <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> exists on the line
<span class="math inline">\(PQ\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\angle PAE=\angle QDE\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\angle PBE=\angle QCE\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> is a cyclic quadrilateral.</p>
