<p>Consider an infinitely large square grid. For which pairs <span
class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> can each of the squares be colored
with one of <span class="math inline">\(a\cdot b\)</span> colors, such
that each rectangle of size <span class="math inline">\(a \times
b\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b \times a\)</span> that is
placed in the grid always contains a unit square of each color?</p>
