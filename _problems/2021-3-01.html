<p>Let <span class="math inline">\((m, n)\)</span> be a pair of positive
integers. Julia has carefully planted <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> rows of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dandelions in an <span
class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> array in her back garden. Now,
Jana and Viviane decide to play a game with a lawnmower they just found.
Taking alternating turns and starting with Jana, they can mow down all
the dandelions in a straight horizontal or vertical line (and they must
mow down at least one dandelion!). The winner is the player who mows
down the final dandelion. Determine all pairs <span
class="math inline">\((m,n)\)</span> for which Jana has a winning
strategy.</p>
