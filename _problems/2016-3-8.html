<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be an acute triangle
with orthocenter <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be the intersection of the line
parallel to <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and the line parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(AH\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> be the point on the line <span
class="math inline">\(GH\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> bisects the line <span
class="math inline">\(HI\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(J\)</span> be the second point of intersection of
<span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> and the circumcircle of the
triangle <span class="math inline">\(CGI\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(IJ=AH\)</span> holds.</p>
