<p>Along the coast of a round island there are 20 different villages.
Each of these villages has 20 fighters and all 400 fighters have
different strengths. Every pair of neighbouring villages <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> organises a competition during which
all <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> fighters from village <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> battles individually against every
fighter from the village <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. The
winner of a battle is always the stronger fighter. We say that the
village <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is <em>stronger</em> than
the village <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, if during at least
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> out of the 400 battles, a fighter
from village <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has won. It turns
out that every village is stronger than its clockwise neighbouring
village. Determine the maximal value of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that allows such an outcome.</p>
