<p>Show that there is no infinite sequence of prime numbers <span
class="math inline">\(p_1,p_2,p_3,\dots\)</span> that fulfils <span
class="math inline">\(p_{k+1}=2p_k-1\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(p_{k+1}=2p_k+1\)</span> for every <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Note that the same formula does not
have to apply for different values of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
