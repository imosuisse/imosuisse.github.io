<p>Determine the largest natural number <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> with the following property: The set of
natural numbers can be divided into <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> disjoint subsets <span
class="math inline">\(A_1,\dots,A_k\)</span> such that each natural
number <span class="math inline">\(n\ge 15\)</span> can be written as a
sum of two different elements from <span
class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> for each <span
class="math inline">\(i \in \{1,\dots,k\}\)</span>.</p>
