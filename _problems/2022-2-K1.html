<p>A school class of <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>
children is taking several group pictures. For every group with at least
one child, there is exactly one picture depicting this specific group.
The pictures are now hung up in different rooms in the school, such that
every child appears in at most one photo per room.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Show that this is possible if the school has <span
class="math inline">\(2^{n-1}\)</span> rooms.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that this is not possible if the school has less than <span
class="math inline">\(2^{n-1}\)</span> rooms.</p></li>
</ol>
