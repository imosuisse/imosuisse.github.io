<p>Given is a circular bus route with <span class="math inline">\(n\geq
2\)</span> stops, which can be travelled in both directions. The
distance between two neighbouring stops is called a <em>section</em>.
One of the stops is called Zurich. A bus should start in Zurich, then
travel exactly <span class="math inline">\(n+2\)</span> sections and end
up back in Zurich. It must visit each stop at least once. It can turn
round at any stop. How many possible routes are there?</p>
