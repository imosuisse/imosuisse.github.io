<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(m,n\)</span> be natural numbers.
Consider a square grid of <span class="math inline">\((2m+1) \times
(2n+1)\)</span> points in the plane. A set of rectangles is called
<em>good</em> if the following holds:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For each of the rectangles, the four vertices lie on grid points
and the sides are parallel to the grid lines.</p></li>
<li><p>No two of the rectangles have a common corner point.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Determine the largest possible value of the sum of the areas of all
rectangles in a good set.</p>
