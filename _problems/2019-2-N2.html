<p>Determine all positive integers <span class="math inline">\(n\geq
2\)</span> that can be written as <span class="math display">\[n =  k^2
+ d^2,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the
smallest divisor of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> greater than
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is any divisor of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
