<p>Consider a board with odd side lengths that is divided into unit
squares. The board without a corner square is somehow covered with
dominoes. You can now move a domino lengthwise by one in one move, such
that the previously empty square is covered, but a new one (two squares
away from it) becomes free. Prove that the empty square can be moved to
any corner of the board in a sequence of moves.</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> A domino consists of two unit squares with a common
side.</p>
