<p>The icy ballroom of the White Witch is shaped like a square, and the
floor is covered by <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span>
identical square tiles. Additionally, between some pairs of adjacent
tiles there are magic edges. The White Witchâ€™s loyal servant Edmund is
tasked with cleaning the ballroom. He starts in one of the corner tiles
and may move up, down, left and right. However, as the floor is
slippery, he will slide in that direction until he hits a wall or a
magic edge. On the upside, he is wearing special shoes that clean each
tile he passes over. Determine the minimum number of magic edges that
need to be placed for Edmund to be able to clean all the tiles.</p>
