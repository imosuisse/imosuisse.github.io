<p>For a finite set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of positive
integers, we call a division into two disjoint non-empty subsets <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> <em>demonic</em> if the least common
multiple of <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> is equal to the
greatest common divisor of <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>.
Determine the minimum number of elements in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> such that there are exactly <span
class="math inline">\(2016\)</span> demonic splits.</p>
