<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer.
Kimiko starts with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> piles of
pebbles each containing a single pebble. She can take an equal number of
pebbles from two existing piles and combine the removed pebbles to
create a new pile. Determine, in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the smallest number of nonempty piles
Kimiko can end up with.</p>
