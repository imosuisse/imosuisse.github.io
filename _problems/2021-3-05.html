<p>For which integers <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span> can
we arrange the numbers <span class="math inline">\(1,2,\dots,n\)</span>
in a row, such that for all integers <span class="math inline">\(1\leq
k\leq n\)</span> the sum of the first <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> numbers in the row is divisible by
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>?</p>
