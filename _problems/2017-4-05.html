<p>Determine the smallest real constant <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> such that for any (not necessarily
distinct) <span class="math inline">\(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5\in
\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}\)</span> there are four pairwise distinct indices
<span class="math inline">\(i,j,k,l\)</span> for which <span
class="math display">\[\left|\frac{a_i}{a_j}-\frac{a_k}{a_l}\right|\leq
C.\]</span></p>
