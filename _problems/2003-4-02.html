<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be an arbitrary acute
triangle. Let <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the feet of the altitudes through
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be the projection of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> onto the line <span
class="math inline">\(EF\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> the projection of <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> onto <span
class="math inline">\(EF\)</span>. Show that the following applies <span
