<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span> be an integer.
Consider the following game: Initially, <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> stones are distributed among the <span
class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> squares of an <span
class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> chessboard. A move consists of
choosing a square containing at least as many stones as the number of
its adjacent squares (two squares are <em>adjacent</em> if they share a
common edge) and moving one stone from this square to each of its
adjacent squares. Determine all positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>There is an initial configuration with <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> stones such that no move is
possible.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an initial configuration with <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> stones such that an infinite sequence
of moves is possible.</p></li>
</ol>
