<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be a convex
quadrilateral such that the circle with diameter <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> is tangent to the line <span
class="math inline">\(CD\)</span>, and the circle with diameter <span
class="math inline">\(CD\)</span> is tangent to the line <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>. Prove that the two intersection
points of these circles and the point <span class="math inline">\(AC\cap
BD\)</span> are collinear.</p>
