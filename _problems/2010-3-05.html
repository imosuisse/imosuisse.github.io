<p>Consider the vertices of a regular <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-corner and connect them somehow with
sides or diagonals to form a closed path that passes through each corner
exactly once. A <em>parallel pair</em> is a set of two different
parallel lines in this line. Show:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even, then there is
always at least one parallel pair.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd, then there is
never exactly one parallel pair.</p></li>
</ol>
