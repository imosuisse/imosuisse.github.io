<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer.
Each of the numbers <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\)</span> is coloured white or
black. One can now repeatedly select a number and recolour it as well as
all numbers that are not divisors of it. Initially all numbers are
white. For which <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> can you achieve
that all numbers are black at some point?</p>
