<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a natural number. Find
the largest number <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> that satisfies
the following property: Let <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots,
x_n\)</span> be a sequence of real numbers. Denote by <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> the maximum length of a monotonically
increasing subsequence of <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots,
x_n\)</span> and by <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the maximum
length of a monotonically decreasing subsequence of <span
class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots, x_n\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(a \cdot b \ge m\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> A monotonically increasing (decreasing) subsequence
of <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots, x_n\)</span> is a sequence of
the form <span class="math inline">\(x_{i_1} \le \dots \le
x_{i_k}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(x_{i_1} \ge \dots \ge
x_{i_k}\)</span>) with <span class="math inline">\(1 \le
i_1&lt;i_2&lt;\dots &lt;i_k \le n\)</span>.</p>
