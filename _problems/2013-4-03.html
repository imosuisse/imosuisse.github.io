<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a natural number. Find
the largest number <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> that satisfies
the following property: Let <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots,
x_n\)</span> be a sequence of real numbers. Denote by <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> the maximum length of a monotonically
increasing subsequence of <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots,
x_n\)</span> and by <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the maximum
length of a monotonically decreasing subsequence of <span
class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots, x_n\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(a \cdot b \ge m\)</span>. <em>Remark:</em> A
monotonically increasing (decreasing) subsequence of <span
class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots, x_n\)</span> is a sequence of the form
<span class="math inline">\(x_{i_1} \le \dots \le x_{i_k}\)</span>
(<span class="math inline">\(x_{i_1} \ge \dots \ge x_{i_k}\)</span>)
with <span class="math inline">\(1 \le i_1&lt;i_2&lt;\dots &lt;i_k \le
n\)</span>.</p>
