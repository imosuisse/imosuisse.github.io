<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be an equilateral
triangle and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> a point in its
interior. <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> are the bases of the perpendiculars
from <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to the sides <span
class="math inline">\(BC, CA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> respectively. Show that the sum of the
areas of the triangles <span class="math inline">\(BXP\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(CYP\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AZP\)</span> does not depend on <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p>
