<p>We call two people a <em>friended pair</em> if they know each other,
and we call them a <em>unfriended pair</em> if they do not know each
other (being friends or not being friends is always mutual). Let <span
class="math inline">\(m,n\)</span> be natural numbers. Find the smallest
natural number <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such that the
following holds: In every group of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> people, there are always <span
class="math inline">\(2m\)</span> people who form <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> disjoint friendly pairs, or there are
<span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> people who form <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> disjoint non-friend pairs.</p>
