<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle, <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> the midpoint of <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> a point on the line <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> lies between <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be a point such that <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are on different sides with respect to
the line <span class="math inline">\(CD\)</span> and such that <span
class="math inline">\(\angle EDC = \angle ACB\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\angle DCE = \angle BAC\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the intersection point of <span
class="math inline">\(CE\)</span> with the parallel line to <span
class="math inline">\(DE\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> be the intersection point of <span
class="math inline">\(AE\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(DF\)</span>. Prove that the lines <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(BF\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(MZ\)</span> intersect in a point.</p>
