<p>Consider a cube and two of its vertices <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, which are the endpoints of a diagonal.
A <em>path</em> is a sequence of cube corners, with each step going from
one corner along an edge of the cube to one of the three neighbouring
corners. Let <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> be the number of
paths of length <span class="math inline">\(2012\)</span> that start in
point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and end in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> be the number of paths of length <span
class="math inline">\(2012\)</span> that start in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and end in <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Decide which of the two numbers <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the larger.</p>
