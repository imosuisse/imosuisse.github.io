organises a party every weekend for all their friends. After the party,
each pair of attendees becomes friends. After each of the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people has had a party once, there are
still two people among them who donâ€™t know each other. Show that these
two will never meet at one of these parties in the future.</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> Two people are always either friends or not
friends.</p>
