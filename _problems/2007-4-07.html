<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_{2007}\)</span> be
a sequence that contains each of the numbers <span
class="math inline">\(1,2,\ldots,2007\)</span> exactly once. The
following operation is now performed repeatedly: If the first sequence
member is equal to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, then the
order of the first <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> sequence
members is reversed. Show that the sequence begins with the number <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> after a finite number of such
operations.</p>
