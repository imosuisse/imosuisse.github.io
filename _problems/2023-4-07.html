<p>Determine all monic polynomials <span class="math inline">\(P(x) =
x^{2023}+a_{2022}x^{2022} + \dots +a_1x + a_0\)</span> with real
coefficients such that <span class="math inline">\(a_{2022} = 0, \; P(1)
= 1\)</span>, and all roots of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>
are real and less than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
