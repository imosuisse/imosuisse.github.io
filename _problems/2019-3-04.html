<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. We
place <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> bowls in a row and number
them from left to right by the numbers <span
class="math inline">\(0,1,\ldots,n\)</span>. In the beginning, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> stones lie in bowl <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and no stone lies in any of the other
bowls. Sisyphus wants to move all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
stones to bowl <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. To do this, in
one step Sisyphus moves exactly one stone from a bowl containing <span
class="math inline">\(k\geq 1\)</span> stones at most <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> bowls to the right. Let <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be the minimal number of steps which
Sisyphus needs to move all stones to bowl <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Show that: <span
class="math display">\[T\geq \left\lceil \frac{n}{1} \right\rceil +
\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil
+ \ldots + \left\lceil \frac{n}{n} \right\rceil.\]</span></p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> As usual, <span class="math inline">\(\lceil x
\rceil\)</span> stands for the least integer larger than or equal to
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
