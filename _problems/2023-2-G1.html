<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle satisfying
<span class="math inline">\(2 \cdot \angle CBA=3 \cdot \angle
ACB\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be points on the side <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span>, such that <span
class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(BE\)</span> divide <span
class="math inline">\(\angle CBA\)</span> into three equal angles and
such that <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> lies between <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Furthermore, let <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> and the angle bisector of <span
class="math inline">\(\angle ACB\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(BE\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(DF\)</span> are parallel.</p>
