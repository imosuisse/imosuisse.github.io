<p>Two circles <span class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> intersect at points <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be the second point of intersection of
<span class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and the tangent line to <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and let <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> be the second point of intersection of
<span class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and the tangent line to <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Prove that the lines <span
class="math inline">\(AD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> are parallel.</p>
