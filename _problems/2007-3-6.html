<p>Three circles of the same size <span
class="math inline">\(k_1,k_2,k_3\)</span> intersect non-tangentially at
a point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be the centres of the circles <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> be the point of intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(k_3\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span>, respectively, which is different
from <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> is a parallelogram.</p>
