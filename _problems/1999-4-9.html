<p>Prove that for every polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> of degree <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> with integer coefficients there is an
infinite arithmetic sequence of integers (in both directions) that
contains none of the values <span class="math inline">\(P(k)\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(k\in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>
