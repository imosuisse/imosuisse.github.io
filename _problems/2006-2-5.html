<p>An <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span>-board is divided
into unit squares. An L-triomino consists of three unit squares: a
central square and two outer squares. An L-triomino is located in the
upper left corner of the board, the central square covering the corner
square of the board. In a move one may rotate the triomino around the
midpoint of one of its outer squares by multiples of <span
class="math inline">\(90^\circ\)</span>. For which <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is it possible to move the triomino to
the lower right corner of the board using a finite number of moves?</p>
