<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> a point on the segment <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be another point on the segment <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> different from <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> be the intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(AX\)</span> with the circumcircle of <span
class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be the second point of intersection of
the circumcircles of <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(DXY\)</span>. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is independent of the choice of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
