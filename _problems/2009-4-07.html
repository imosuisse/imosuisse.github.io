<p>Consider a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(2009\)</span> points in the plane, no three of
which lie on a line. A triangle whose vertices all lie in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is called an <em>internal
triangle</em>. Prove that every point of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is contained in the interior of an even
number of internal triangles.</p>
