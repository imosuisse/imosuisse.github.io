<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span> be an integer.
Consider an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> chessboard
with the usual chessboard colouring. A move consists of choosing a <span
class="math inline">\(1\times 1\)</span> square and switching the colour
of all squares in its row and column (including the chosen square
itself). For which <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is it possible
to get a monochrome chessboard after a finite sequence of moves?</p>
