<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with <span
class="math inline">\(\angle CAB=2\cdot \angle ABC\)</span>. Assume that
there exists a point <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> in the
interior of triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(AD = BD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CD = AC\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(\angle ACB=3\cdot \angle DCB\)</span>.</p>
