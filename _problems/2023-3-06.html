<p>Determine all integers <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 3\)</span>
such that <span class="math display">\[n!\mid
\prod_{\substack{p&lt;q\leq n\\ p,q \text{ prime}}}(p+q).\]</span>
<em>Remark:</em> The expression on the right-hand side denotes the
product over all sums of two distinct primes less than or equal to <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(n =
6\)</span>, this is equal to <span
class="math inline">\((2+3)(2+5)(3+5)\)</span>.</p>
