<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> pieces on a board
with <span class="math inline">\(5 \times 9\)</span> squares, with a
maximum of one piece on each square at any time. A move consists of
moving each piece to one of its four neighbouring squares (up, down,
left or right). This is done simultaneously for all pieces. If a stone
is moved horizontally in one turn, it must be moved vertically in the
next turn and vice versa. Determine the largest value for <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> so that there is a starting position
for the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> pieces and a sequence of
moves such that the game can continue indefinitely.</p>
