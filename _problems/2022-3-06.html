<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 3\)</span> be an integer.
Annalena has infinitely many cowbells in each of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> different colours. Given an integer
<span class="math inline">\(m \ge n+1\)</span> and a group of <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> cows standing in a circle, she is
tasked with tying one cowbell around the neck of every cow so that every
group of <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> consecutive cows have
cowbells of all the possible <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
colours. Prove that there are only finitely many values of <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> for which this is not possible and
determine the largest such <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in
terms of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
