<p>A space station consists of <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span>
chambers, and each pair of chambers is connected by a tunnel. There are
a total of <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> main tunnels that can
be used in both directions, the rest are all one-way tunnels. A group of
four chambers is called <em>connected</em> if you can get from any of
these chambers to any other by using only the six tunnels that connect
these chambers to each other. Determine the largest possible number of
connected groups of four.</p>
