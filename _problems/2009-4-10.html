<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive and let
<span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> be two different integers with
the following property: For every natural number <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a^m-b^m\)</span> is divisible by <span
class="math inline">\(n^m\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> are both divisible by <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
