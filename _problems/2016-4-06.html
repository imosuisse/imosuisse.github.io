<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer.
Show that <span class="math inline">\(7^{7^{n}}+1\)</span> has at least
<span class="math inline">\(2n+3\)</span> not necessarily different
prime divisors. <em>Remark:</em> <span class="math inline">\(18 = 2\cdot
3\cdot 3\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> prime
divisors.</p>
