What is the maximum number of <span class="math inline">\(1\times
1\)</span> squares that can be coloured black in an <span
class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> square, such that in every
<span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> square at most <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> small squares are coloured black?</p>
