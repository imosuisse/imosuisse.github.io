<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with <span
class="math inline">\(\angle BAC = 60^\circ\)</span>. The points <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> lie on the sides <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> respectively. The lines <span
class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CE\)</span> intersect the circumcircle of <span
class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> again at the points <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> respectively. Let <span
class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CE\)</span> intersect <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Prove that the lines <span
class="math inline">\(BY\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CX\)</span> are parallel if and only if <span
class="math inline">\(AESD\)</span> is a cyclic quadrilateral.</p>
