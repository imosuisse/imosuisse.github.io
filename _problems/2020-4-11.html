<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots\)</span> be an
infinite sequence of non-negative integers satisfying <span
class="math inline">\(a_i \leq i\)</span> for every <span
class="math inline">\(i \geq 0\)</span> and such that for every integer
<span class="math inline">\(n\geq 1\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\binom{n}{a_0} + \binom{n}{a_1} + \dots +
\binom{n}{a_n} = 2^n.\]</span> Prove that each non-negative integer
appears in the sequence.</p>
