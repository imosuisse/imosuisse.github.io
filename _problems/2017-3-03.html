<p>The main building of ETH is a rectangle consisting of unit squares.
Each side of a unit square is a wall, where some walls have doors. The
perimeter walls of the building have no doors. Some number of Olympiad
participants have gotten lost in the building. They can only move though
doors between the unit squares. We assume that for any two unit squares,
there is a way to get from one to the other.</p>
<p>Cyril wants to get all participants to assemble on the same unit
square. To achieve this, he can broadcast the following instructions:
North, South, East, and West. Each time he announces an instruction, all
participants simultaneously try to move one unit square in the
corresponding direction. If the wall in question has no door, they stay
put.</p>
<p>Show that Cyril can achieve his goal by giving a finite number of
instructions, no matter how the participants are initially
distributed.</p>
