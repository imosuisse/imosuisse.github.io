<p>The main building of ETH is a rectangle consisting of unit squares.
Each side of a unit square is a wall, where some walls have doors. The
perimeter walls of the building have no doors. Some number of Olympiad
participants have gotten lost in the building. They can only move though
doors between the unit squares. We assume that for any two unit squares,
there is a way to get from one to the other. Cyril wants to get all
participants to assemble on the same unit square. To achieve this, he
can broadcast the following instructions: North, South, East, and West.
Each time he announces an instruction, all participants simultaneously
try to move one unit square in the corresponding direction. If the wall
in question has no door, they stay put. Show that Cyril can achieve his
goal by giving a finite number of instructions, no matter how the
participants are initially distributed.</p>
