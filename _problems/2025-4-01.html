<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a positive integer. Leo
owns an empty garden that measures <span
class="math inline">\(45\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\(45\)</span> units. He wants to plant flowers in
each of the <span class="math inline">\(2025\)</span> unit squares, and
can plant one square with flowers each morning. However, whenever
flowers are planted in a square, then <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> days later in the evening, any
orthogonally adjacent empty square will become infested with weeds.
Infested squares can no longer have flowers planted in them. Find the
minimum value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such that Leo
can plant his entire garden with flowers.</p>
