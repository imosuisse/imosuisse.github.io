<p>Prove for each positive real number <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and each integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\geq 1\)</span>, the following inequality holds
<span class="math display">\[a^{n} + \frac{1}{a^{n}} - 2 \geq
n^{2}\left(a + \frac{1}{a} - 2\right),\]</span> and determine all
equality cases.</p>
