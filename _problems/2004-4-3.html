<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be an isosceles triangle
with <span class="math inline">\(|AC|=|BC|\)</span> with incircle <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a point on the circumcircle of the
triangle <span class="math inline">\(AIB\)</span> which lies within the
triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>. The lines through
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(CA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CB\)</span>, intersect <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> respectively. The line parallel to
<span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(CA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CB\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> respectively. Show that the two lines
<span class="math inline">\(DF\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(EG\)</span> intersect on the circumcircle of the
triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>.</p>
