<p>The numbers <span class="math inline">\(1,2,\ldots,2006\)</span> are
placed arbitrarily on a circle. Two neighbouring numbers on the circle
can now be swapped repeatedly. After a sequence of such swaps, each of
the numbers is diametrically opposed to its starting position. Prove
that, at least once, two numbers with sum <span
class="math inline">\(2007\)</span> have been swapped.</p>
