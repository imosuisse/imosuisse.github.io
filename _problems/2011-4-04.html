<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a natural number. There
are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertical bars and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> monkeys, one at the bottom of each
bar.</p>
<p>To give the monkeys some exercise, the keepers place a banana at the
top of each pole for feeding. In addition, they connect the poles with a
finite number of ropes such that two different rope ends are attached to
different points. No two rope ends are attached to the same point. Now
all the monkeys climb upwards, and whenever they encounter one end of a
rope, they climb across it to its other end and continue upwards from
there. Prove that regardless of how the ropes are placed, each monkey
will get exactly one banana.</p>
