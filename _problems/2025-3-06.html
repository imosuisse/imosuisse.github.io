<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n,a,b\)</span> be positive integers
with <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>. Aru and Wero are
playing a game on a <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> grid.
At the beginning, there is a single pebble in the bottom-left corner. A
move consists of removing one pebble from some non-empty square <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and performing at least one (possibly
both) of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>adding <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> pebbles to the
right neighbour of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>adding <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> pebbles to the
upper neighbour of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Aru starts and they alternate moves. The first player that cannot
make a move loses. Determine who, if anyone, has a winning strategy in
terms of <span class="math inline">\(n, a, b\)</span>.</p>
