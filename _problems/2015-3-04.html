constrict, with ruler and compass, a circle <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are on <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> and the circles <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> touch.</p>
