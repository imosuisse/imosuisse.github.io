<p>Each vertex of a regular <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span>-gon
(<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 3\)</span>) is labelled with a
distinct number from the set <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,\ldots,2n\}\)</span> in such a way that the
sum of the numbers of neighbouring vertices is always equal to the sum
of the numbers in the two diametrically opposite vertices. Show that
this is possible if and only if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
is odd.</p>
