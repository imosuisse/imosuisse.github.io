<p>The plane is divided into unit squares. Each square is to be coloured
with one of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> colours, so that the
following applies: If four squares can be covered with an L-tetromino,
then these squares have four different colours (the L-tetromino can be
rotated and mirrored). Determine the smallest value of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for which this is possible.</p>
