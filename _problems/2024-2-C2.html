<p>Consider a <span class="math inline">\(2024 \times 2024\)</span>
grid, where the <span class="math inline">\(2024\)</span> squares on one
of the two diagonals are coloured blue. Sam writes one of the numbers
<span class="math inline">\(1, 2, \dots, 2024^2\)</span> in each of the
squares of the grid in such a way that every number appears exactly once
and the squares containing <span class="math inline">\(i-1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> share an edge for any <span
class="math inline">\(2 \le i \le 2024^2\)</span>. Prove there are
always two blue squares containing values that differ by exactly <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p>
