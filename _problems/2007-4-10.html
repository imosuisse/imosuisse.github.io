<p>For a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> let
<span class="math display">\[f(n)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \left\lfloor
\frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor.\]</span> Prove that there are infinitely many
positive integers <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> for which the
inequality <span class="math inline">\(f(m)&lt;f(m+1)\)</span> holds,
and that there are infinitely many positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> for which the inequality <span
class="math inline">\(f(m)&gt;f(m+1)\)</span> holds.</p>
