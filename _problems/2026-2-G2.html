<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A, B, C, D, E\)</span> be five points
lying on a circle in this order, such that <span
class="math inline">\(AE\)</span> is a diameter and <span
class="math inline">\(BC &gt; CD\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(AD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(BE\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> be the circumcenter of the triangle
<span class="math inline">\(BFD\)</span>. Let the reflection of the line
<span class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> across <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> and the reflection of the line <span
class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> across <span
class="math inline">\(DC\)</span> intersect at <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\angle OYC =
90^\circ\)</span>.</p>
