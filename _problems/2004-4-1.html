<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be the set of all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples <span
class="math inline">\((X_1,\ldots,X_n)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(X_1,\ldots,X_n\)</span> are subsets of <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,\ldots,1000\}\)</span>, not all of which
have to be different, and which can also be empty. For <span
class="math inline">\(a = (X_1,\ldots,X_n) \in S\)</span> denote <span
class="math display">\[E(a) = \text{ number of elements of } X_1 \cup
\ldots \cup X_n.\]</span> Find an explicit expression for the sum <span
class="math display">\[\sum_{a \in S} E(a).\]</span></p>
