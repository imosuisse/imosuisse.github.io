<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> be a fixed circle
with two fixed points <span class="math inline">\(A, B\)</span> on it.
For a variable point <span class="math inline">\(P\not\in\{A,
B\}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be the center of gravity of the
triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABP\)</span>. The parallel to line
<span class="math inline">\(GP\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> at point <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and the line <span
class="math inline">\(CG\)</span> intersects the circumcircle of the
triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABG\)</span> a second time at point
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Prove that as <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> varies, the point <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> lies on a fixed circle.</p>
