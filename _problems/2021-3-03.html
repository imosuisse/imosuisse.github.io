<p>Find all finite sets <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of
positive integers with at least two elements, such that if <span
class="math inline">\(m&gt;n\)</span> are two elements of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, then <span
class="math display">\[\frac{n^2}{m-n}\]</span> is also an element of
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
