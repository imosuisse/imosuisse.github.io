<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k&#39;\)</span> be two concentric circles with
midpoint <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. Let the circle <span
class="math inline">\(k&#39;\)</span> be larger than the circle <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. A line through <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k&#39;\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, such that <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> lies between <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Another line through <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k&#39;\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, such that <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> lies between <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Show that the circumcircle of <span
class="math inline">\(OAE\)</span>, the circle with diameter <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> and the circle with diameter <span
class="math inline">\(EF\)</span> intersect at a point.</p>
