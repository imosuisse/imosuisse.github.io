<p>A hunter and a rabbit are playing the following game on the cells of
an infinite square grid. First, the hunter fixes a colouring of the
cells using finitely many colours. After that, the rabbit secretly
chooses a cell to start in. Each turn, the rabbit reports the colour of
its current cell to the hunter and then secretly moves to an adjacent
cell (sharing an edge) that has not been visited before. The hunter wins
if at any point of the game either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They can determine with certainty the current cell the rabbit is
in.</p></li>
<li><p>The rabbit cannot make a legal move.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Determine if the hunter has a winning strategy.</p>
