<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> be four points on a circle in
this order. Assume that there is a point <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> on the segment <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> bisects <span
class="math inline">\(KC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> bisects <span
class="math inline">\(KD\)</span>. Determine the minimal value that
<span class="math inline">\(\left|\frac{AB}{CD}\right|\)</span> can
take.</p>
