<p>Consider three faces of an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n
\times n\)</span> cube that meet at one of the corners of the cube. For
which <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is it possible to cover
them completely and without overlapping with strips of paper of size
<span class="math inline">\(3\times 1\)</span>?</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> The paper strips can also be glued over the edges
between these cube faces.</p>
