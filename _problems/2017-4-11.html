<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(B=(-1,0)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C=(1,0)\)</span> be fixed points in the plane. A
non-empty, bounded subset <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of the
plane is called <em>kind</em> if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a point <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> such that for each other point <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, the segment <span
class="math inline">\(TQ\)</span> is completely inside <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For each triangle <span class="math inline">\(P_1P_2P_3\)</span>,
there exists a unique point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and a permutation <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(\{1, 2, 3\}\)</span> such that the triangles <span
class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(P_{\sigma(1)}P_{\sigma(2)}P_{\sigma(3)}\)</span>
are similar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Show that there are two kind subsets <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> of the set <span
class="math inline">\(\{(x,y):x\geq 0,y\geq 0\}\)</span> with the
property that the product <span class="math inline">\(BA\cdot
BA&#39;\)</span> is independent of the triangle <span
class="math inline">\(P_1P_2P_3\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(A\in S\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A&#39;\in S&#39;\)</span> are the points
guaranteed by the second condition above for the arbitrary triangle
<span class="math inline">\(P_1P_2P_3\)</span>.</p>
