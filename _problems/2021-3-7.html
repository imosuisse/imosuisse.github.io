<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(m\geq n\)</span> be positive
integers. Frieder is given <span class="math inline">\(mn\)</span>
posters of Linus with different integer dimensions <span
class="math inline">\(k \times l\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(1 \le k \le m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1 \le l \le n\)</span>. He must put them all up
one by one on his bedroom wall without rotating them. Every time he puts
up a poster, he can either put it on an empty spot on the wall, or on a
spot where it entirely covers a single visible poster and does not
overlap any other visible poster. Determine the minimal area of the wall
that will be covered by posters.</p>
