<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be an inscribed
quadrilateral with circumcenter <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>
such that the diagonals <span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> are perpendicular. Let <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> be the line symmetric of the diagonal
<span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> with respect to the angle
bisector of <span class="math inline">\(\angle BAD\)</span>. Prove that
<span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> lies on the line <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.</p>
