<p>Let the sequence <span class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2,
\ldots\)</span> of integers be defined as follows: <span
class="math display">\[a_n =
\begin{cases}
    0 \text{\,,\, if $n$ has an even number of divisors greater than
2014}\\
    1 \text{\,,\, if $n$ has an odd number of divisors greater than
2014}
\end{cases}\]</span> Show that the sequence <span
class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> never becomes periodic.</p>
