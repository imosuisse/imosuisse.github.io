<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with
circumcircle <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(D \neq A\)</span> be the second intersection of
the internal bisector of <span class="math inline">\(\angle BAC\)</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>. We define <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to be the intersection of line <span
class="math inline">\(CD\)</span> with the line perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> to be the circumcircle of <span
class="math inline">\(ADE\)</span>. The line parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(AD\)</span> passing through <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(F
\neq E\)</span>. Moreover, let the tangents to <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> intersect at <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(TF\)</span> is tangent to <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>.</p>
