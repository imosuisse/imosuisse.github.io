<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be a prime number and
<span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> three different positive
integers smaller than <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Assume
that <span class="math inline">\(x^3,y^3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z^3\)</span> have the same remainder when dividing
by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(x^2+y^2+z^2\)</span> is then divisible by <span
class="math inline">\(x+y+z\)</span>.</p>
