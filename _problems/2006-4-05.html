<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> a point in its interior. Let <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be a point on the line <span
class="math inline">\(AD\)</span> different from <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_2\)</span> be the circumcircles of the
triangles <span class="math inline">\(BDE\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CDE\)</span> respectively. <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_2\)</span> intersect the segment <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> at the points <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> respectively. Let the intersection of
<span class="math inline">\(DG\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> be <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and the intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(DF\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> be <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(XY\)</span> is parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>.</p>
