<p>A floor plan is given which is composed of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> unit squares. Albert and Berta want to
cover this floor with tiles, whereby all tiles have the shape of a <span
class="math inline">\(1\times 2\)</span> domino or a T-tetromino. Albert
only has tiles of one colour available, whereas Berta has dominoes in
two colours and tetrominoes in four colours. Albert can cover this floor
plan with tiles in <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> ways, Berta in
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> ways. Assuming that <span
class="math inline">\(a\neq 0\)</span> applies, determine the ratio
<span class="math inline">\(b/a\)</span>.</p>
