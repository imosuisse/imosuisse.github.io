<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> different points on
a circle. The numbers <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> are arbitrarily assigned to these
points. Each point is connected to exactly one other point by a straight
line, and none of these lines intersect. If a line connects the numbers
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, we assign the value <span
class="math inline">\(|a-b|\)</span> to the line. Show that we can
choose the lines so that the sum of these values is <span
class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span>.</p>
