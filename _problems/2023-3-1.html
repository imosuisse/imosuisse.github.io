<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be an acute triangle
with incentre <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. On its
circumcircle, let <span class="math inline">\(M_A,M_B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_C\)</span> be the midpoints of minor arcs <span
class="math inline">\(BC,CA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> respectively. Prove that the
reflection of <span class="math inline">\(M_A\)</span> over the line
<span class="math inline">\(IM_B\)</span> lies on the circumcircle of
the triangle <span class="math inline">\(IM_BM_C\)</span>.</p>
