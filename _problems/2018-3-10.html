<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p\geq 2\)</span> be a prime number.
Arnaud and Louis alternatively choose an index <span
class="math inline">\(i\in \{0,1,\ldots,p-1\}\)</span> that has not
already been chosen and a digit <span
class="math inline">\(a_i\in\{0,1,\ldots,9\}\)</span>. Arnaud starts.
Once every index has been chosen, they compute the following sum: <span
class="math display">\[a_0+a_1\cdot 10+\ldots+a_{p-1}\cdot
10^{p-1}=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}a_i\cdot 10^i.\]</span> If the sum is divisible
by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, Arnaud wins. Otherwise Louis
wins. Prove that Arnaud has a winning strategy.</p>
