<p>Let <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> be a pair of positive
integers. Henning and Paul are playing a game: Initially, there are two
piles of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> stones, respectively, on a table. The
pair <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> is called the
<em>initial configuration</em> of the game. The players proceed as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The players alternate and Henning begins.</p></li>
<li><p>In each turn, a player either removes a positive number of stones
from one of the two piles or the same positive number of stones from
both piles.</p></li>
<li><p>The player who removes the last stone from the table wins the
game.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the set of all positive
integers <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> for which there exists a
positive integer <span class="math inline">\(b&lt;a\)</span> such that
Paul has a winning strategy for the initial configuration <span
class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span>. Order the elements of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> increasingly as <span
class="math inline">\(a_1&lt;a_2&lt;\ldots\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prove that the set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is
infinite.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that the sequence <span class="math inline">\((m_k)_{k \geq
1}\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(m_k := a_{k+1} -
a_k\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(k\geq 1\)</span> is not
eventually periodic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Remark</em>: A sequence <span class="math inline">\((x_k)_{k \geq
1}\)</span> is <em>eventually periodic</em> if there exists an integer
<span class="math inline">\(k_0\geq 0\)</span> such that the sequence
<span class="math inline">\((x_{k+k_0})_{k\geq 1}\)</span> is
periodic.</p>
