<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be an isoceles
trapezoid with <span class="math inline">\(AD&gt;BC\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the intersection point of the angle
bisector of <span class="math inline">\(\angle BAC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be the intersection point of <span
class="math inline">\(DB\)</span> with the parallel to the angle
bisector of <span class="math inline">\(\angle CBD\)</span> through
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the intersection point of <span
class="math inline">\(DC\)</span> and the parallel to the angle bisector
of <span class="math inline">\(\angle DCB\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(AEFD\)</span> is a cyclic quadrilateral.</p>
