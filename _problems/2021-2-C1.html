<p>Anaëlle has <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> stones labelled
<span class="math inline">\(1,2,3,\ldots,2n\)</span> as well as a red
box and a blue box. She wants to put each of the <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> stones into one of the two boxes such
that the stones <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(2k\)</span> are in different boxes for all <span
class="math inline">\(k=1,2,\dots,n\)</span>. How many possibilities
does Anaëlle have to do so?</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> Partial points are awarded for computing the number
of possibilities for any particular integer <span
class="math inline">\(n \geq 3\)</span>.</p>
