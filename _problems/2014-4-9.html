<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. The
FÃ¼rst of Liechtenstein wants to connect the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> cities of his country with <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> roads, such that the following
holds:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can drive from any city to any other city along the <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> roads.</p></li>
<li><p>No city is on more than two roads.</p></li>
<li><p>No two roads cross each other.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Show that the number of possibilities the president has to build the
roads is minimal if and only if the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> cities form a convex <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gon.</p>
