<p>Find all polynomials <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> with real
coefficients having no repeated roots, such that for any complex number
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, the equation <span
class="math inline">\(zP(z)=1\)</span> holds if and only if <span
class="math inline">\(P(z-1)P(z+1)=0\)</span>.</p>
