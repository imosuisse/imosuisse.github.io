<p>A <em>palindrome</em> is a natural number, such that in the decimal
system its value is the same, regardless of whether it is read from the
front or from the back (for example <span
class="math inline">\(1129211\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(7337\)</span>). Determine all the pairs <span
class="math inline">\((m,n)\)</span> of natural numbers such that <span
class="math display">\[(\underbrace{11\dots 11 }_{m})\cdot
(\underbrace{11\dots 11}_{n})\]</span> is a palindrome.</p>
