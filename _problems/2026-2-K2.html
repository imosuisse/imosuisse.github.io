<p>Mark has <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> bookshelves of
heights <span class="math inline">\(1, 1, 2, 2,  \dots, 10, 10\)</span>,
where two bookshelves of the same height are indistinguishable. He wants
to place them in a line in such a way that his cat can jump from one
bookshelf to the next, starting on the leftmost bookshelf and ending on
the rightmost bookshelf. His cat is lazy and has two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exactly one of the cat’s nineteen jumps is from a bookshelf to a
strictly taller bookshelf.</p></li>
<li><p>Between two bookshelves of the same height, no strictly taller
bookshelf can be placed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In how many ways can Mark place his bookshelves satisfying both
conditions?</p>
