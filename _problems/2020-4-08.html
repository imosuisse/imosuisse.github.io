<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> be the incenter of a
non-isosceles triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>. Let
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the intersection of the
perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(AI\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be the point on the circumcircle of
<span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(MB=MC\)</span> and such that <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is on the same side of the line <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> be the second intersection of the line
<span class="math inline">\(MI\)</span> with the circumcircle of <span
class="math inline">\(BIC\)</span>. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(FN\)</span> is tangent to the circumcircle of
<span class="math inline">\(BIC\)</span>.</p>
