<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with
circumcircle <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a circle passing through <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is in the interior of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. The tangent to <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> at two points <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, such that <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are on different sides of <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(PC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the intersection of <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(QB\)</span>, prove that <span
class="math inline">\(MN\)</span> is parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(PQ\)</span>.</p>
