<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 4\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k,d\geq 2\)</span> be integers such that <span
class="math inline">\(k \cdot d \leq n\)</span>. The <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> contestants of the Mathematical
Olympiad are sitting around a round table, waiting for Patrick to
arrive. When Patrick arrives, he is unhappy about the situation because
it violates the rules of social distancing. He therefore chooses <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> contestants to stay and tells the
others to leave the room such that between any two of the remaining
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> contestants, there are at least
<span class="math inline">\(d-1\)</span> empty chairs. How many
possibilities does Patrick have to do so if every chair was occupied in
the beginning?</p>
