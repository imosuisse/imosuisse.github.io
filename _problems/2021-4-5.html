<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer.
Some of the squares of a <span class="math inline">\(3n \times
3n\)</span> board are marked. For any marked square <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, we denote by <span
class="math inline">\(\ell(T)\)</span> the number of marked squares in
the same row to the left of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and
by <span class="math inline">\(d(T)\)</span> the number of marked
squares in the same column below <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.
Determine the maximal number of marked squares given that <span
class="math inline">\(\ell(T)+d(T)\)</span> is even for every marked
square <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
