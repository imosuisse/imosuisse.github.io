<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer.
Pingu the penguin and his <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> penguin
friends are collecting salmon. Every penguin has at most <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> salmon, and no two penguins have the
same number of salmon. In how many ways can the <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> penguins split into some number of
groups of arbitrary sizes, such that each group has exactly <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> total salmon?</p>
