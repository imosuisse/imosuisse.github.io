<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be an odd prime. Arnaud
has hung up <span class="math inline">\(N\geq 1\)</span> towels to dry
on a washing line, each coloured either purple or yellow. Then, for each
<span class="math inline">\(1 \leq n \leq N\)</span>, he calculates what
fraction of the first <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> towels are
yellow, and writes down these <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>
fractions in their irreducible form on a piece of paper. Julia finds the
piece of paper the next day and notices that all of the fractions <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{p}, \frac{2}{p}, \dots,
\frac{p-1}{p}\)</span> are on the paper. Prove that <span
class="math display">\[N \geq \frac{p^3-p}{4}.\]</span></p>
