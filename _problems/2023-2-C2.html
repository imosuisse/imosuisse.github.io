<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer.
Roger has a <span class="math inline">\((2n+1) \times (2n+1)\)</span>
square garden. He puts down fences to divide his garden into rectangular
plots. He wants to end up with exactly two horizontal <span
class="math inline">\(k \times 1\)</span> plots and exactly two vertical
<span class="math inline">\(1 \times k\)</span> plots for each
<strong>even</strong> integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(2n+1\)</span>, as well as a single <span
class="math inline">\(1 \times 1\)</span> square plot. How many
different ways are there for Roger to do this?</p>
