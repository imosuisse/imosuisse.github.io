<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 6\)</span> be a perfect
number. Let <span class="math inline">\(p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdot
\ldots\cdot p_k^{a_k}\)</span> be the prime factorisation of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> where we assume that <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 &lt; p_2&lt;\ldots&lt;p_k\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a_i&gt;0\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots, k\)</span>. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> is even.</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> An integer <span class="math inline">\(n\geq
2\)</span> is called a <em>perfect number</em> if the sum of its
positive divisors, excluding <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
itself, is equal to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. For example,
<span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is perfect, as its positive
divisors are <span class="math inline">\(\{1, 2, 3, 6\}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(1+2+3 = 6\)</span>.</p>
