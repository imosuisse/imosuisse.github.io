<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k \leq a \leq b\)</span> be positive
integers. Ruhi has a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(a +
b\)</span> letters that contains <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>
copies of the letter <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> copies of the letter <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. She wants the sequence to have exactly
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> pairs of consecutive letters that
form the word <span class="math inline">\(MO\)</span>. In how many ways
can she arrange the letters?</p>
