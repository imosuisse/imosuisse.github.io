<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> be unique, arbitrarily chosen solutions
to the equation <span class="math inline">\(z^{1997}-1=0\)</span>.
Determine the probability that <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}}\leq |v+w|\)</span> holds.</p>
