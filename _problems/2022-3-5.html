<p>For an integer <span class="math inline">\(a\geq 2\)</span>, denote
by <span class="math inline">\(\delta(a)\)</span> the second largest
divisor of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\((a_n)_{n\geq 1}\)</span> be a sequence of integers
such that <span class="math inline">\(a_1\geq 2\)</span> and <span
class="math display">\[a_{n+1} = a_n + \delta(a_n)\]</span> for all
<span class="math inline">\(n\geq 1\)</span>. Prove that there exists a
positive integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(a_k\)</span> is divisible by <span
class="math inline">\(3^{2022}\)</span>.</p>
