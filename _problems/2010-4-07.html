<p>In a country there are finitely many cities and finitely many roads.
Each road connects two different cities and each two cities are
connected by at most one road. All roads can be travelled in both
directions and the road network is set up so that every city can be
reached from every other city (possibly via detours). For each city,
there is also an even number of roads leading away from that city. The
government now decides to convert all roads into one-way streets. This
is to be done in such a way that for each city the number of roads
leading out is equal to the number of roads leading in.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Show that this is always possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that you can still reach any city from any other, no matter
how the government implements its plan.</p></li>
</ol>
