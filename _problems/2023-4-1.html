<p>In a garden, there are <span class="math inline">\(2023\)</span> rose
bushes planted in a row. Each bush contains either red or blue roses.
Vicky is taking a walk and wants to pick some of the flowers. She starts
at a bush of her choice, and picks a rose from it to add to her basket.
She then continues walking down the row and picks a single flower from
each bush she visits. Vicky can skip some bushes, but she cannot skip
two adjacent bushes. She can leave the garden at any point. Let <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> be the number of red and blue roses she
picked, respectively. Determine the maximal value of <span
class="math inline">\(|r-b|\)</span> Vicky can achieve, irrespective of
the configuration of bushes.</p>
