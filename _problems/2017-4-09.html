<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with <span
class="math inline">\(AB=AC\neq BC\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> be the center of its inscribed circle.
The line <span class="math inline">\(BI\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and the perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> though <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(AI\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Show that the reflection of <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> is on the circumcircle of <span
class="math inline">\(BDE\)</span>.</p>
