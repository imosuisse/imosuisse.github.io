<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(m, n \geq 2\)</span> be positive
integers. We have four colours and want to colour each unit square of a
<span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> board with one of them
such that in every <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span>
square all four colours occur. How many different possibilities are
there?</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> We count two possibilities as different if there is
at least one square which received different colours.</p>
