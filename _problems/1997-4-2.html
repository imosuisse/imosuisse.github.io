<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be a convex
quadrilateral. Determine necessary and sufficient conditions, such that
there exists a point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in the
interior of <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span>, such that the
four triangles <span class="math inline">\(ABP\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(BCP\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(CDP\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(DAP\)</span> all have equal area.</p>
