<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(GERMANYISHOT\)</span> be a regular
dodecagon. The lines <span class="math inline">\(GN\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(MI\)</span> intersect at point <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Prove that</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the circumcircle of triangle <span
class="math inline">\(GIP\)</span> is the same size as the circumcircle
of <span class="math inline">\(GERMANYISHOT\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>the distance <span class="math inline">\(PA\)</span> is the same
length as one side of <span
class="math inline">\(GERMANYISHOT\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
