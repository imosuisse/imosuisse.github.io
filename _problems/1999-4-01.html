<p>Two circles intersect at the two points <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be another point on the circle,
different from <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. The straight lines <span
class="math inline">\(AM\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AN\)</span> intersect the second circle again at
the points points <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Show that the tangent to the first
circle at point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is parallel to
the line <span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>.</p>
