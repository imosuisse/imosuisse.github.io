<p>Determine the maximal length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>
of a sequence <span class="math inline">\(a_1, \dots, a_L\)</span> of
positive integers satisfying both of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>every term in the sequence is less than or equal to <span
class="math inline">\(2^{2024}\)</span>, and</p></li>
<li><p>there does not exist a consecutive subsequence <span
class="math inline">\(a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(1 \le i \le j \le L\)</span>) with a choice of
signs <span class="math inline">\(s_i, s_{i+1}, \dots, s_j \in
\{1,-1\}\)</span> for which <span class="math display">\[s_ia_i +
s_{i+1}a_{i+1} + \dots + s_ja_j = 0.\]</span></p></li>
