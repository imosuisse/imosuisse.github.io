<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 6\)</span> be a natural
number. Consider a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct real numbers. Prove that there
are at least <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> distinct
two-element subsets of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> such that
the arithmetic mean of the two elements in each of these subsets is at
least equal to the arithmetic mean of all elements in <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
