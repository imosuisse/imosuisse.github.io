<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with
circumcircle <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(A_1,B_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> be points on the interior of the
sides <span class="math inline">\(BC,CA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> respectively. Let <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a point on <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and denote by <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> the second intersection of the
circumcircles of <span class="math inline">\(BC_1X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CB_1X\)</span>. Define the points <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> to be the intersections of <span
class="math inline">\(BY\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(B_1A_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CY\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(C_1A_1\)</span>, respectively. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> lies on the line <span
class="math inline">\(PQ\)</span>.</p>
