<p>Consider an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span>-matrix
with the entry <span class="math inline">\(i+j-1\)</span> in the field
of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th row and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th column. What is the smallest
possible product of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> numbers of
this matrix if it is required that each row and each column contains one
of these <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> numbers?</p>
