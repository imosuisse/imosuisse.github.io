<p>Determine all strictly increasing sequences <span
class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\)</span> of positive
integers such that for all <span class="math inline">\(i,j \in
\mathbb{N}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i+j\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a_i+a_j\)</span> have the same number of
divisors.</p>
