<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> secret agents
working in Geneva. Each agent monitors at least one other agent, but no
two agents monitor each other. Assume that for any <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> agents, they can be numbered in such a
way that the first agent monitors the second, the second the third and
so on, and the tenth the first. Show that for any <span
class="math inline">\(11\)</span> agents, they can also be numbered in
such a way that each agent monitors the next.</p>
