<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with <span
class="math inline">\(AB &lt; AC\)</span>. Denote its circumcircle by
<span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, its circumcenter by <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, and its incenter by <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be the midpoint of the arc <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> not containing <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Line <span
class="math inline">\(OI\)</span> meets <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, and line <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> meets <span
class="math inline">\(ME\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(MF\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, respectively. Suppose that <span
class="math inline">\(IA = IM\)</span>. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(IKML\)</span> is a rectangle.</p>
