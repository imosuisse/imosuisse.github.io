<p>A plane is divided into a grid of equilateral triangles of side
length <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Consider an equilateral
triangle of side length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, whose
sides lie on the lines of the grid. On every lattice point on the edge
and in the interior of this triangle lies a stone. In one turn, a unit
triangle is selected which has a stone on exactly <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> corners. The two stones are removed and
a new stone is placed on the third corner. For which <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is it possible that only one piece
remains after a finite number of moves?</p>
