<p>Johann and Nicole are playing a game on the coordinate plane. First,
Johann draws any polygon <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> and then Nicole can shift
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> to wherever she wants.
Johann wins if there exists a point with coordinates <span
class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> in the interior <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are coprime integers. Otherwise, Nicole
wins. Determine who has a winning strategy.</p>
