<p>A <em>path</em> in the plane leads from the point <span
class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span> to the point <span
class="math inline">\((6,6)\)</span>, where you can either go <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to the right or <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> upwards in each step. How many paths
are there that contain neither the point <span
class="math inline">\((2,2)\)</span> nor the point <span
class="math inline">\((4,4)\)</span>?</p>
