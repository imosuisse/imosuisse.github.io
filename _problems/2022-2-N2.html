<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer and
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> a positive divisor of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Show that if <span
class="math display">\[\frac{d^2+d+1}{n+1}\]</span> is an integer, then
it is equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
