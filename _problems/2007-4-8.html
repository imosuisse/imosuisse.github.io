<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCDE\)</span> be a convex pentagon
with <span class="math display">\[\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \angle DAE
\qquad
\text{and} \qquad \angle ABC = \angle ACD = \angle ADE.\]</span> The
diagonals <span class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CE\)</span> meet in <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Show that the line <span
class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> intersects the side <span
class="math inline">\(CD\)</span> at its midpoint.</p>
