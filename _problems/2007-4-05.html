<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> be natural numbers. A parliament
consists of <span class="math inline">\(mn\)</span> deputies who have
formed <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> commissions, so that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each committee consists of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>
deputies.</p></li>
<li><p>Each deputy is a member of exactly <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> commissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Two committees have at most one member in common.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Determine the largest possible value of <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> as a function of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> so that this is possible.</p>
