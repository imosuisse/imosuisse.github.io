<p>The cells of an <span class="math inline">\(8\times 8\)</span>
chessboard are all coloured in white. A move consists in inverting the
colours of a rectangle <span class="math inline">\(1\times 3\)</span>
horizontal or vertical (the white cells become black and conversely). Is
it possible to colour all the cells of the chessboard in black in a
finite number of moves?</p>
