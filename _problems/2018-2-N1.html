<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span> be a positive
integer. Let <span class="math inline">\(d_1, \ldots, d_r\)</span> be
all the positive divisors of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that
are smaller that <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Determine every
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for which <span
class="math display">\[\operatorname{lcm}(d_1, \ldots, d_r) \neq
n.\]</span> <em>Remark:</em> For <span
class="math inline">\(n=18\)</span> we have for instance <span
class="math inline">\(d_1 = 1, d_2 = 2, d_3 = 3, d_4 = 6, d_5=9\)</span>
and thus <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{lcm}(1,2,3,6,9) =
18\)</span>.</p>
