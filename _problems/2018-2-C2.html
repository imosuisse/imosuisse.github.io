<p>A building has <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> lifts and each
lift only stops at <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> floors.
However, for any two floors there is always a lift connecting them
directly. Prove that this building has at most <span
class="math inline">\(14\)</span> floors and that one can build such a
building with <span class="math inline">\(14\)</span> floors.</p>
