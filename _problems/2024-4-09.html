<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be an acute triangle
with orthocenter <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, satisfying
<span class="math inline">\(AC &gt; AB &gt; BC\)</span>. The
perpendicular bisectors of <span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> intersect line <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> respectively. Let <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> be points on lines <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> respectively, both different from
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, such that <span
class="math inline">\(AB = BP\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AC = CQ\)</span>. Prove that the distances from
point <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> to lines <span
class="math inline">\(SP\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(RQ\)</span> are equal.</p>
