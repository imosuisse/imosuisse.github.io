<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be an acute-angled
triangle and the points <span class="math inline">\(D,E\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the feet of the altitudes
through <span class="math inline">\(A,B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> respectively. Let <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be the point of intersection of the
line <span class="math inline">\(EF\)</span> with the line perpendicular
to <span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Prove that the triangle <span
class="math inline">\(DES\)</span> is isosceles.</p>
