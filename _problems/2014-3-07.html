<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 4\)</span> towns on a
round lake, between which <span class="math inline">\(n-4\)</span>
passenger ferries and a green car ferry operate. Each ferry connects two
non-adjacent cities, with no two ferry routes crossing each other to
avoid collisions. The following change can be made to better adapt the
transport routes to the needs of passengers: A new route can be assigned
to any ferry. The routes of the other ferries may not be crossed or
changed at the same time. Let Santa Marta and Cape Town be two
non-neighboring cities. Show that you can make a finite number of route
changes such that the green car ferry runs between Santa Marta and Cape
Town after these changes.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> At no time may two ferries run between the same cities
or one ferry run between two neighboring cities.</p>
