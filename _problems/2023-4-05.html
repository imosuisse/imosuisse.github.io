<p>The Tokyo Metro system is one of the most efficient in the world.
There is some odd positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such that each metro line passes
through exactly <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> stations, and
each station is serviced by exactly <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> metro lines. One can get from any
station to any other station using only one metro line â€“ but this
connection is unique. Furthermore, any two metro lines must share
exactly one station. David is planning an excursion for the IMO team,
and wants to visit a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> stations. He remarks that no three of
the stations in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are on a common
metro line. Show that there is some station not in <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, which is connected to every station in
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> by a different metro line.</p>
