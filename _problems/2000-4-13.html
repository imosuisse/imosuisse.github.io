<p>The incircle of the triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>
touches the sides <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CA\)</span> at the points <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a point in the interior of <span
class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> such that the incircle of <span
class="math inline">\(ABP\)</span> also touches the side <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Additionally, let the incircle touch
the sides <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(BP\)</span> at the points <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Show that the four points <span
class="math inline">\(E, F, R\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> lie on a circle.</p>
