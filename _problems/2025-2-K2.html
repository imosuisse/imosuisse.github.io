<p>The <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> participants of the
Olympiad are trying to escape Wonderland. They arrive at a row of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> closed doors, ordered in decreasing
size. For every <span class="math inline">\(1\leq k\leq n\)</span>,
there is exactly one participant that fits through the first <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> doors, but not the others. One by one,
in some order, the participants approach the row of doors to pass
through it. Each participant walks along the row of doors, starting at
the largest one. If they come across an open door they fit through, they
walk through it and close it behind them. If they reach the last door
they fit through and it is closed, they open it and go through it,
leaving it open behind them. If at the end all doors are closed again,
all the participants can escape safely. In how many different orders can
the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> participants approach the row
of doors while achieving this?</p>
