<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_1&lt;a_2&lt; \ldots
&lt;a_n\)</span> be a sequence of positive integers with the property
that for <span class="math inline">\(i&lt;j\)</span> the decimal
representation of <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span> does not
start with that of <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> (for
example, the numbers <span class="math inline">\(137\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(13729\)</span> cannot both occur in the sequence).
Prove that <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{a_i} \leq
\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\ldots+\frac{1}{9}\]</span></p>
