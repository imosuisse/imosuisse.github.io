<p>A circle with circumference <span class="math inline">\(6n\)</span>
is divided by <span class="math inline">\(3n\)</span> points into <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> intervals of lengths <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> respectively. Show that one
can always pick two of these points such that they lie diametrically
opposite to each other.</p>
