<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. A
volleyball team consisting of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> men
and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> women is preparing to play.
Every player is assigned one of the positions <span
class="math inline">\(1,2,\ldots,2n\)</span> of which exactly the
positions <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> lie outside the court. During the
game, the players rotate in such a way that the player on position <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> switches to position <span
class="math inline">\(i+1\)</span> (respectively from position <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>). In how many ways can the positions
initially be assigned so that there are always at least <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> women on the court, no matter how
many rotations have occured?</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> Two initial positions are different, if at least one
player is assigned to two different positions.</p>
