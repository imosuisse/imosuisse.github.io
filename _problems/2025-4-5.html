<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> be a real number
satisfying <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 180\)</span>.
For Leoâ€™s birthday, Frieder has placed <span
class="math inline">\(2025\)</span> gnomes at arbitrary points inside
his garden. No three gnomes are collinear and no two gnomes coincide.
Each gnome has a field of view spanning <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> degrees (including the boundary).
After Frieder places the gnomes down, Leo wants to rotate the gnomes
such that, for each gnome, the number of other gnomes it sees is
different. Determine all values of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> for which Leo can achieve this,
regardless of how the gnomes are placed.</p>
