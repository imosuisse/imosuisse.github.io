<p>A positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span> is
called <em>resistant</em> if it is coprime to the sum of all its
divisors (including <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>). What is the maximal number of
consecutive resistant numbers?</p>
