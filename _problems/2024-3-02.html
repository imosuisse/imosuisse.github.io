<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with
incenter <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, and let <span
class="math inline">\(J\)</span> be the reflection of <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> with respect to line <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> be the second intersection of line
<span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> with the circumcircle of
triangle <span class="math inline">\(CIJ\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be the second intersection of line
<span class="math inline">\(BI\)</span> with the circumcircle of
triangle <span class="math inline">\(AIK\)</span>. Prove that the lines
<span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(JL\)</span> are parallel.</p>
