<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_k\)</span> be different divisors
of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. An identity of the form <span
class="math inline">\(n=t_1+t_2+ \ldots +t_k\)</span> is called a
<em>representation</em> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as a
sum of different divisors. Two such representations are considered equal
if they differ only in the order of the summands (for example, <span
class="math inline">\(20=10+5+4+1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(20=5+1+10+4\)</span> are twice the same
representation of <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> as the sum of
different divisors). Let <span class="math inline">\(a(n)\)</span> be
the number of different representations of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as the sum of different divisors.
Determine whether there is an <span class="math inline">\(M \in
\mathbb{N}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a(n)\leq M\)</span>
for all <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span>.</p>
