<p>Consider <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span> points in a
three-dimensional space. Three of these points each span a plane, and it
is known that the <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span> points span
exactly <span class="math inline">\(2002\)</span> different planes in
this way. Prove that one of these planes contains at least <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> of the points.</p>
