<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be a quadrilateral
containing an incircle with <span
class="math inline">\(BC&gt;BA\)</span>. Let the point <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> lie on the line <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(BP=BA\)</span>. Show that the angle bisector of
<span class="math inline">\(\angle BCD\)</span>, the perpendicular to
<span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and the perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> intersect at a point.</p>
