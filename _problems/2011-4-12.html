<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a &gt; 1\)</span> be a natural number
and let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> be polynomials with integer
coefficients. Suppose there is a natural number <span
class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(g(n) &gt;0\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(n \geq n_0\)</span> and <span
class="math display">\[f(n)\mid a^{g(n)} - 1 \quad \text{for all} \ n
\geq n_0.\]</span> Show that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must
be constant.</p>
