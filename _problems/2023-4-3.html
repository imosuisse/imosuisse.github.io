<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle, and let
<span class="math inline">\(l_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(l_2\)</span> be two parallel lines. For <span
class="math inline">\(i=1, 2\)</span>, assume <span
class="math inline">\(l_i\)</span> meets the lines <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(CA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> respectively. Suppose that the line
through <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>, the line through <span
class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">\(CA\)</span>, and finally the line through <span
class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>, determine a non-degenerate triangle
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta_i\)</span>. Show that the
circumcircles of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_2\)</span> are tangent to each other.</p>
