<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a graph whose vertices
are the integers. Assume that any two integers are connected by a finite
path in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. For two integers <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we denote by <span
class="math inline">\(d(x,y)\)</span> the length of the shortest path
from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, where the length of a path is the
number of edges in it. Assume that <span
class="math inline">\(d(x,y)\mid x-y\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(x,y\in\Z\)</span> and define <span
class="math inline">\(S(G) = \{d(x,y)\mid x,y\in\Z\}\)</span>. Find all
possible sets <span class="math inline">\(S(G)\)</span>.</p>
