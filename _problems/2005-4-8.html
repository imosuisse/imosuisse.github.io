<p>Consider a lake with two islands in it and seven cities on the shore.
We will call the islands and cities <em>places</em> for short. There is
a ship connection which connects exactly the following pairs of
places</p>
<ul>
<li><p>between the two islands,</p></li>
<li><p>between each city and each island,</p></li>
<li><p>between two cities only if they are not neighbouring.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these connections is offered by exactly one of two competing
transport companies. Prove that there are always three places such that
there are ship connections of the same company between every two of
these places.</p>
