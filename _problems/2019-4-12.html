<p>Define the sequence <span class="math inline">\((a_n)_{n\geq
0}\)</span> of integers by <span
class="math inline">\(a_n:=2^n+2^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\)</span>. Prove
that there are infinitely many terms of the sequence which can be
expressed as a sum of two or more distinct terms of the sequence, as
well as infinitely many terms which cannot be expressed in such a
way.</p>
