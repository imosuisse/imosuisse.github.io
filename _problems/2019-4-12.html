<p>Define the sequence <span class="math inline">\((a_n)_{n\geq
0}\)</span> of integers by <span
class="math inline">\(a_n:=2^n+2^{\floor{n/2}}\)</span>. Prove that
there are infinitely many terms of the sequence which can be expressed
as a sum of two or more distinct terms of the sequence, as well as
infinitely many terms which cannot be expressed in such a way.</p>
