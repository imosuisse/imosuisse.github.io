<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span> positive integers
written on a blackboard. Show that you can choose some (perhaps all) of
these numbers and place the signs <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> between them so that the
result is divisible by <span class="math inline">\(2011\)</span>.</p>
