<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. We
call a pair of numbers <em>coprime</em> if their greatest common divisor
is equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. What is the minimum
number of coprime pairs that occur when the numbers <span
class="math inline">\(\{1, 2, \ldots, 2n\}\)</span> are divided into
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> pairs?</p>
