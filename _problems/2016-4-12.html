<p>There are three tasks in an OFM exam, where an integer score between
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span> can be achieved in each task. Show that
there are always two students out of <span
class="math inline">\(49\)</span>, such that one was at least as good as
the other in each of the three tasks.</p>
