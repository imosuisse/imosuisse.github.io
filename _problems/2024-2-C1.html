<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer.
Annalena has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> different bowls
numbered <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and also <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> apples, <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> bananas and <span
class="math inline">\(5n\)</span> strawberries. She wants to combine
ingredients in each bowl to make fruit salad. The fruit salad is
<em>delicious</em> if it contains strictly more strawberries than
bananas and strictly more bananas than apples. How many ways are there
for Annalena to distribute all the fruits to make delicious fruit salad
in each of the different bowls?</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> A delicious fruit salad is allowed to not contain
any apples.</p>
