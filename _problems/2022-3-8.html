<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle and let
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a point in the interior of the
side <span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(I_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(I_2\)</span> be the incenters of the triangles
<span class="math inline">\(APB\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(APC\)</span>, respectively. Let <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the closest point to <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> on the line <span
class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(XI_1\)</span> is perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">\(XI_2\)</span>. Prove that the distance <span
class="math inline">\(AX\)</span> is independent of the choice of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p>
