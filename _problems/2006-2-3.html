<p>In triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> define <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> as the intersection of the angle
bisector of <span class="math inline">\(\angle BAC\)</span> with the
side <span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>. Assume that the
circumcenter of triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>
coincides with the incenter of triangle <span
class="math inline">\(ADC\)</span>. Determine the angles of the triangle
<span class="math inline">\(\ABC\)</span>.</p>
