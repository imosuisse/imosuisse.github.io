<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a circle and <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
be two points on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. At these points
the tangents to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> are drawn and the
tangent segments <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(BQ\)</span> of the same length are plotted in
clockwise direction. Prove that the segment <span
class="math inline">\(PQ\)</span> is bisected by the line <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>.</p>
