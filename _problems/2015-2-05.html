<p>A <em>staircase</em> tile consists of <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> unit squares, arranged as in the name.
For which pairs <span class="math inline">\((m,n)\)</span> of positive
integers with <span class="math inline">\(m,n\geq 6\)</span> is it
possible to cover an <span class="math inline">\(m\times n\)</span>
field with staircases, without gaps or overlaps?</p>
