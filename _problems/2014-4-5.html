<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle in which
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha=\angle BAC\)</span> is the smallest
angle (strictly). Let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a point
on side <span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> a point on line <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> lies between <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\angle
BPD=\alpha\)</span>. Similarly, let <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be a point on the line <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> lies between <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\angle
EPC=\alpha\)</span>. Show that the lines <span
class="math inline">\(AP\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(BE\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CD\)</span> are concurrent if and only if <span
class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> is perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>.</p>
