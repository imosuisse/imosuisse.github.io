<p>In the triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> be the midpoint of the side <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> the projection of <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> onto <span
class="math inline">\(AD\)</span>. Assume that <span
class="math inline">\(\angle ACE = \angle ABC\)</span>. Show that the
triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> is either isosceles or
right-angled.</p>
