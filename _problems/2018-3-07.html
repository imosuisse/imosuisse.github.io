<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a natural integer and
let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be the number of ways to
write <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as the sum of one or more
consecutive natural integers. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is equal to the number of odd positive
divisors of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> 9 has three positive odd divisors and <span
class="math inline">\(9=9\)</span>,  <span
class="math inline">\(9=4+5\)</span>,  <span
class="math inline">\(9=2+3+4\)</span>.</p>
