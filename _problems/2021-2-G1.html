<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> be the centre of the
circumcircle of an acute triangle <span
class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>. The line <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> intersects the circumcircle of the
triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABO\)</span> a second time at <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Prove that the line <span
class="math inline">\(OS\)</span> is perpendicular to the line <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>.</p>
