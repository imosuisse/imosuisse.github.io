<p>Show that there are more than <span
class="math inline">\(10^{13}\)</span> ways to place <span
class="math inline">\(81\)</span> kings on an <span
class="math inline">\(18\times 18\)</span> chessboard in such a way that
no two kings attack each other.</p>
<p><em>Remark:</em> Two kings can attack each other if the squares on
which they stand have a common side or a common corner.</p>
