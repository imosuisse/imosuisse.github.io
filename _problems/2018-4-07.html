<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. A
sequence of <span class="math inline">\(3n\)</span> letters is called
<em>Romanian</em> if the letters <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> appear exactly <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times each. Define a <em>swap</em> to
be the transposition of two adjacent letters. Prove that for any
Romanian sequence <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, there exists a
Romanian sequence <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> cannot be obtained from <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> using fewer than <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{3n^2}{2}\)</span> swaps.</p>
