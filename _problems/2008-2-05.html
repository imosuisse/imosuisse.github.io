<p>A square board consists of <span class="math inline">\(2n \times
2n\)</span> squares. You want to mark <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of these squares so that no two marked
squares are in the same or neighbouring rows, and so that no two marked
squares are in the same or neighbouring columns. In how many ways is
this possible?</p>
