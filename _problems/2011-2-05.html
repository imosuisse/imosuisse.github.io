<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be a cyclic
quadrilateral such that the reflections of the lines <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> at the angle bisectors of the angles
<span class="math inline">\(\angle CAD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\angle CBD\)</span> intersect at a point <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> be the centre of the circumcircle of
<span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(OP\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CD\)</span> are perpendicular to each other</p>
