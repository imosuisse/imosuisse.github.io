<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 2\)</span> be a natural number.
An <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> board is completely
covered with <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> squares. The
<span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> squares consist of two
diagonally opposite black unit squares and two diagonally opposite white
unit squares. The <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> squares
may be rotated and they may also overlap, but they must lie completely
on the <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> board. What is the
minimum number of black squares visible in such a covering?</p>
