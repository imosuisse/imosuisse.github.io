<p>We call a positive integer <em>likeable</em> if the digits of its
decimal representation fulfill the following two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each of the digits <span class="math inline">\(0,1,\ldots,
9\)</span> occurs at most once.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is an even digit and
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is an odd digit, then there are
exactly <span class="math inline">\(\frac{A+B-1}{2}\)</span> other
digits between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Determine the number of likeable numbers.</p>
