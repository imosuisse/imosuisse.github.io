<p>A <span class="math inline">\(7\times 7\)</span> square is divided
into <span class="math inline">\(49\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(1\times 1\)</span> squares. Two beetles walk along
the sides of the small squares, so that each beetle follows its own
closed path and passes exactly once through each of the <span
class="math inline">\(64\)</span> vertices of the small squares. What is
the minimum number of sides of the small squares that have been
traversed by both beetles?</p>
