<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a polynomial with real
coefficients such that the equation <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)=P(1-x)\)</span> holds for all real <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Prove that a real polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> exists with <span
class="math display">\[P(x)=Q\big(x(1-x)\big).\]</span></p>
