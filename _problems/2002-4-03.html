<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer with
at least four different positive divisors. Let the four smallest of
these divisors be <span class="math inline">\(d_1, d_2, d_3,
d_4\)</span>. Find all such numbers <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for which <span
class="math display">\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 = n.\]</span></p>
