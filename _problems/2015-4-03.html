<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle with <span
class="math inline">\(AB &gt; AC\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be the midpoint of the side <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> also be a point on the side <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(DB = DC\)</span>. The line parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and the line <span
class="math inline">\(BM\)</span> intersect at the point <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(\angle KCD = \angle DAC\)</span> holds.</p>
