<p>David and Linus play the following game: David chooses a subset <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\{1,
\dots ,2018\}\)</span>. Then Linus chooses a natural number <span
class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and computes inductively the numbers
<span class="math inline">\(a_2, \dots, a_{2018}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(a_{n+1}\)</span> being the product of all positive
divisors of <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be the set of integers <span
class="math inline">\(k\in\{1,\dots,2018\}\)</span> for which <span
class="math inline">\(a_k\)</span> is a perfect square. Linus wins if
<span class="math inline">\(P=Q\)</span>. Otherwise David wins.
Determine which player has a winning strategy.</p>
