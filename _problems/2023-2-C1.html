<p>During the World Cup, there are <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> different Panini stickers to collect.
Marco’s friends are trying to complete their collection, but nobody has
a full set of stickers yet! A pair of his friends are said to be
<em>wholesome</em> if their combined collection has at least one of each
sticker. Marco knows the contents of everyone’s collections, and wants
to take them all to a restaurant for his birthday. However, he doesn’t
want any wholesome pairs sitting at the same table.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Show that Marco might need to reserve at least <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> different tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> tables will
always be enough for Marco to achieve his goal.</p></li>
</ol>
