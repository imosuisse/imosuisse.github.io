<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(m,n \geq 2\)</span> be integers. On
each unit square of a <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span>
grid there is a coin. Initially all coins show heads. Jérôme repeatedly
performs the following operation. First, he selects a <span
class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> square within the grid and
then does one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Flipping all coins in the chosen <span class="math inline">\(2
\times 2\)</span> square except the top-right one.</p></li>
<li><p>Flipping all coins in the chosen <span class="math inline">\(2
\times 2\)</span> square except the bottom-left one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Determine all pairs <span class="math inline">\((m,n)\)</span> for
which, at some point, Jérôme can make all coins show tails at the same
time.</p>
