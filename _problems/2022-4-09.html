<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> be a quadrilateral
inscribed in a circle <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>. Let
the tangent to <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> intersect the rays <span
class="math inline">\(BA\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> at points <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, respectively. A point <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is chosen inside the triangle <span
class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> so that <span
class="math inline">\(TE\)</span> is parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(CD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(TF\)</span> is parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(AD\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(K\neq
D\)</span> be a point on the segment <span
class="math inline">\(DF\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(TD=TK\)</span>. Prove that the lines <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(DT\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(BK\)</span> intersect at one point.</p>
