<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be a non-empty set of
positive integers such that for any <span class="math inline">\(n\in
S\)</span>, all positive divisors of <span
class="math inline">\(2^n+1\)</span> are also in <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> contains an integer of the form <span
class="math display">\[(p_1 p_2 \dots p_{2023})^{2023},\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(p_1,p_2, \ldots, p_{2023}\)</span> are
distinct prime numbers, all greater than <span
class="math inline">\(2023\)</span>.</p>
