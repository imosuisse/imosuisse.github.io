<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span> be an integer.
Switzerland and Liechtenstein are performing their annual festive show.
There is a field subdivided into <span class="math inline">\(n \times
n\)</span> squares, in which the bottom-left square contains a red house
with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> Swiss gymnasts, and the
top-right square contains a blue house with <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> Liechtensteiner gymnasts. Every other
square only has enough space for a single gymnast at a time. Each second
either a Swiss gymnast or a Liechtensteiner gymnast moves. The Swiss
gymnasts moves to either the square immediately above or to the right
and the Liechtensteiner gymnasts moves either to the square immediately
below or to the left. The goal is to move all the Swiss gymnasts to the
blue house and all the Liechtensteiner gymnasts to the red house, with
the caveat that a gymnast cannot enter a house until all the gymnasts of
the other nationality have left. Determine the largest <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for which this is possible.</p>
