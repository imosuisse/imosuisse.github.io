<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer.
Each tile in a <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> square
contains one of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct symbols,
such that each symbol is in precisely <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> squares. Prove that there exists a line
or a column containing at least <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
distinct symbols.</p>
