<p>There are two non-empty stacks of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> coins respectively on a table. The
following operations are allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The same number of coins is removed from both stacks.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of coins in a stack is tripled.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For which pairs <span class="math inline">\((n,m)\)</span> is it
possible that there are no more coins after a finite number of
operations?</p>
