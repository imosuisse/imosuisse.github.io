<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be an acute triangle
with <span class="math inline">\(AB \neq AC\)</span> and orthocenter
<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Let the midpoint of side <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> be <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Let the points <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> be such that <span
class="math inline">\(AE = AD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D,H,E\)</span> lie on a straight line. Show that
<span class="math inline">\(HM\)</span> and the common chord of the
circumcircles of the two triangles <span
class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(ADE\)</span> are perpendicular to each other.</p>
