<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span> be an integer. Each
of the squares of an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span>
board contains a bit-coin with <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> on
one side, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> on the other.
Initially, all bit-coins in the leftmost column show a <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. A move consists of one of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Within any row, look at the rightmost two neighbouring bit-coins
that display different numbers (if they exist) and flip both of these as
well as all bit-coins to their right.</p></li>
<li><p>Within any column, look at the topmost two neighbouring bit-coins
that display different numbers (if they exist) and flip both of these as
well as all bit-coins above them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Find the minimal value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such
that there always exists a sequence of moves resulting in at most <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> bit-coins showing <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
