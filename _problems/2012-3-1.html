<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(2012\)</span> chameleons
sitting at a round table. At the beginning, each has the colour red or
green. After every full minute, every chameleon that has two neighbours
of the same colour changes its colour from red to green or from green to
red. All others keep their colour. Show that after <span
class="math inline">\(2012\)</span> minutes there are at least <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> chameleons that have changed colour the
same number of times.</p>
