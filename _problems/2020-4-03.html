<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a circle with centre
<span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> be a chord of this circle with
midpoint <span class="math inline">\(M \neq O\)</span>. The tangents of
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> at the points <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> intersect at <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. A line goes through <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and intersects <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(CT
&lt; DT\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(BC = BM\)</span>. Prove
that the circumcentre of the triangle <span
class="math inline">\(ADM\)</span> is the reflection of <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> across the line <span
class="math inline">\(AD\)</span>.</p>
