<p>The wizards Albus and Brian are playing a game on a square of side
length <span class="math inline">\(2n+1\)</span> metres surrounded by
lava. In the centre of the square there sits a toad. In a turn, a wizard
chooses a direction parallel to a side of the square and enchants the
toad. This will cause the toad to jump <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> metres in the chosen direction, where
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is initially equal to <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and increases by <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> after each jump. The wizard who sends
the toad into the lava loses. Albus begins and they take turns.
Depending on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, determine which
wizard has a winning strategy.</p>
