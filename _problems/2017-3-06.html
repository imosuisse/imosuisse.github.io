<p>The MO camp has at least <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>
leaders. Any two leaders are either friends or foes. In each group of
<span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> leaders, there is at least one
that is friends with the other <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.
Must there necessarily be a leader who is friends with all other
leaders?</p>
