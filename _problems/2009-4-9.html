<p>In an acute triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>, let
<span class="math inline">\(BE\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CF\)</span> be altitudes. Two circles through
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> touch the line <span
class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, such that <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> lies between <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Prove that the lines <span
class="math inline">\(PE\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(QF\)</span> intersect on the circumcircle of <span
class="math inline">\(AEF\)</span>.</p>
