<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> be a triangle. The angle
bisector of <span class="math inline">\(\angle ACB\)</span> intersects
<span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> be points on the circumcircles of <span
class="math inline">\(CAD\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(CDB\)</span> respectively, such that <span
class="math inline">\(TH\)</span> is a common tangent to the two
circumcircles and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is inside the
quadrilateral <span class="math inline">\(BATH\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(BATH\)</span> is cylic.</p>
