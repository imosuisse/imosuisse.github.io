<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(924\)</span> fans of the
Liechtenstein football team from either Liechtenstein or Switzerland who
have gathered to get the autographs of their favourite players. There
are <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span> players on the team, and
every fan has exactly <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> favourite
players. No two people from a given country share the same group of
favourites, and in the end everyone got exactly one autograph from one
of their favourite players. Show that there is a player who gave an
autograph to both a Swiss and a Liechtensteiner person.</p>
