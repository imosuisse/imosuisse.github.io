<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 3\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a convex <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gon. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> can be decomposed into triangles using
<span class="math inline">\(n-3\)</span> non-intersecting diagonals such
that the circumcircle of each of these triangles contains all of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. When exactly does such a decomposition
exist?</p>
