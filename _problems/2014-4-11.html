<p>Determine all natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
with the following property: For any prime <span
class="math inline">\(p&lt;n\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(n-\lfloor \frac{n}{p}\rfloor p\)</span> is not
divisible by the square of a positive integer greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. <em>Remark:</em> For <span
class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\lfloor x\rfloor\)</span> is defined as the
largest integer less than or equal to <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
