Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle CAB = 90^\circ $. The point $L$ lies on the side $BC$.
The circumcircle of the triangle $ABL$ intersects the line $AC$ at $M$ and the circumcircle
of the triangle $CAL$ intersects the line $AB$ at $N$.
Assume that $N$ lies on the side $AB$ and $M$ lies on the line $AC$.
Show that $L, M$ and $N$ lie on a line.
