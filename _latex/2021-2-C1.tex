Anaëlle has $2n$ stones labelled $1,2,3,\ldots,2n$ as well as a red box and a blue box.
She wants to put each of the $2n$ stones into one of the two boxes such that
the stones $k$ and $2k$ are in different boxes for all $k=1,2,\dots,n$.
How many possibilities does Anaëlle have to do so?

\emph{Remark:} Partial points are awarded for computing the number of possibilities
for any particular integer $n \geq 3$.
