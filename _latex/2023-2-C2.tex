Let $n$ be a positive integer.
Roger has a $(2n+1) \times (2n+1)$ square garden.
He puts down fences to divide his garden into rectangular plots.
He wants to end up with exactly two horizontal $k \times 1$ plots and
exactly two vertical $1 \times k$ plots for each \textbf{even} integer $k$ between $1$ and $2n+1$,
as well as a single $1 \times 1$ square plot.
How many different ways are there for Roger to do this?
