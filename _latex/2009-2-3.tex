Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle BAC = 60^\circ$.
The points $D$ and $E$ lie on the sides $AC$ and $AB$ respectively.
The lines $BD$ and $CE$ intersect the circumcircle of $ABC$ again at the
points $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Let $BD$ and $CE$ intersect $S$.
Prove that the lines $BY$ and $CX$ are parallel if and only if $AESD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
