Let $k$, $n$ and $r$ be positive integers with $r < n$.
Mickey has $kn + r$ black socks and $kn + r$ white socks.
He wants to hang them on a straight clothesline in such a way that
there are no $2n$ consecutive socks of which $n$ of them are black and $n$ of them are white.
Show that he can do this if and only if $r \geq k$ and $n > k + r$ holds.
