Let points $P$ and $Q$ lie on a circle $k_1$ with centre $O$.
Let $k_2$ be the circle which is centered at $P$ and passes through $Q$.
Define $X$ as the second intersection of $k_2$ and line $PQ$,
and $Y$ as the second intersection of $k_2$ and $k_1$.
Let $Z$ be the intersection of $OX$ with $QY$.
Prove that if $PZYX$ is cyclic, then $PYX$ is an equilateral triangle.
