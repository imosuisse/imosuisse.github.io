Two circles $k_1$ and $k_2$ intersect at $A$ and $B$. Let $r$ be a line through $B$ that
intersects $k_1$ at $C$ and $k_2$ at $D$ such that B lies between $C$ and $D$.
Let $s$ be the line parallel to $AD$ that touches $k_1$ in $E$ and that has the smallest
possible distance to $AD$. The line $AE$ intersects $k_2$ in $F$.
Let $t$ be the tangent to $k_2$ through $F$. Prove that holds:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] The line $t$ is parallel to $AC$.
    \item[b)] The lines $r$, $s$ and $t$ intersect at a single point.
\end{enumerate}
