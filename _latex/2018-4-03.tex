Along the coast of a round island there are 20 different villages.
Each of these villages has 20 fighters and all 400 fighters have different strengths.
Every pair of neighbouring villages $A$ and $B$ organises a competition during
which all $20$ fighters from village $A$ battles individually against every fighter from the village $B$.
The winner of a battle is always the stronger fighter.
We say that the village $A$ is \emph{stronger} than the village $B$,
if during at least $k$ out of the 400 battles, a fighter from village $A$ has won.
It turns out that every village is stronger than its clockwise neighbouring village.
Determine the maximal value of $k$ that allows such an outcome.
