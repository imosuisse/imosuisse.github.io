Let $n$ be a positive integer.
A sequence of $3n$ letters is called \emph{Romanian} if
the letters $I$, $M$ and $O$ appear exactly $n$ times each.
Define a \emph{swap} to be the transposition of two adjacent letters.
Prove that for any Romanian sequence $X$,
there exists a Romanian sequence $Y$ such that $Y$ cannot be obtained from $X$ using
fewer than $\frac{3n^2}{2}$ swaps.
