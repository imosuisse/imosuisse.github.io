Let $ABC$ be a triangle satisfying $2 \cdot \angle CBA=3 \cdot \angle ACB$.
Let $D$ and $E$ be points on the side $AC$,
such that $BD$ and $BE$ divide $\angle CBA$ into three equal angles and such that $D$ lies between $A$ and $E$.
Furthermore, let $F$ be the intersection of $AB$ and the angle bisector of $\angle ACB$.
Show that $BE$ and $DF$ are parallel.
