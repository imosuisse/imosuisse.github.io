Consider the vertices of a regular $n$-corner and connect them somehow with sides or
diagonals to form a closed path that passes through each corner exactly once.
A \emph{parallel pair} is a set of two different parallel lines in this line. Show:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] If $n$ is even, then there is always at least one parallel pair.
    \item[b)] If $n$ is odd, then there is never exactly one parallel pair.
\end{enumerate}
