At the beginning, each child has an even number of sweets.
In each step, each child has to give half of its sweets to the child sitting on its right.
If after a step a child has an odd number of sweets, it gets one additional sweet from the teacher.
Show that after a finite number of steps all children have the same amount of sweets.
