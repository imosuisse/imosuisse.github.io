Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_{2007}$ be a sequence that contains each of the numbers $1,2,\ldots,2007$
exactly once. The following operation is now performed repeatedly:
If the first sequence member is equal to $n$, then the order of the first $n$ sequence
members is reversed.
Show that the sequence begins with the number $1$ after a finite number of such operations.
