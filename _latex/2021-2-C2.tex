Let $n\geq 4$ and $k,d\geq 2$ be integers such that $k \cdot d \leq n$.
The $n$ contestants of the Mathematical Olympiad are sitting around a round table,
waiting for Patrick to arrive.
When Patrick arrives, he is unhappy about the situation because it violates the rules of social distancing.
He therefore chooses $k$ of the $n$ contestants to stay and tells the others to leave the room such that
between any two of the remaining $k$ contestants, there are at least $d-1$ empty chairs.
How many possibilities does Patrick have to do so if every chair was occupied in the beginning?
