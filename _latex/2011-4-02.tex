The line $g$ intersects the circle $k$ at the points $A$ and $B$.
The perpendicular bisector of the line $AB$ intersects $k$ again at $C$ and $D$.
Now let $P$ be another point on $g$ that lies outside $k$. The parallels
to $CA$ and $CB$ through $P$ intersect the lines $CB$ and $CA$ at the points $X$ and $Y$.
Prove that $XY$ is perpendicular to $PD$.
