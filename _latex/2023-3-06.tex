Determine all integers $n\geq 3$ such that
\[
    n!\mid \prod_{\substack{p<q\leq n\\ p,q \text{ prime}}}(p+q).
\]
\emph{Remark:} The expression on the right-hand side denotes the product
over all sums of two distinct primes less than or equal to $n$.
For $n = 6$, this is equal to $(2+3)(2+5)(3+5)$.
