Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$.
Let $D \neq A$ be the second intersection of the internal bisector of $\angle BAC$ with $\Gamma$.
We define $E$ to be the intersection of line $CD$ with the line perpendicular to $BC$ through $B$,
and $\omega$ to be the circumcircle of $ADE$.
The line parallel to $AD$ passing through $E$ intersects $\omega$ at $F \neq E$.
Moreover, let the tangents to $\Gamma$ at $A$ and $C$ intersect at $T$.
Prove that $TF$ is tangent to $\omega$.
