Let $k$ be a circle with centre $M$ and let $AB$ be a diameter of $k$.
Furthermore, let $C$ be a point on $k$ such that $AC = AM$.
Let $D$ be the point on the line $AC$ such that $CD = AB$ and $C$ lies between $A$ and $D$.
Let $E$ be the second intersection of the circumcircle of $BCD$ with line $AB$
and $F$ be the intersection of the lines $ED$ and $BC$.
The line $AF$ cuts the segment $BD$ in $X$.
Determine the ratio $BX/XD$.
