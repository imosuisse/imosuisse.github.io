\emph{Snipping} a convex $n$-gon means the following: You select two neighbouring sides $AB$ and
$BC$ and replace them by the lines $AM, MN, NC$, where $M \in AB$ and $N \in BC$ are arbitrary
points inside these lines. In other words, you cut off a corner and get a $(n\!+\!1)$-gon.\\
Starting from a regular hexagon $P_6$ with area $1$, a sequence
$P_6, P_7, P_8,\ldots$ of convex polygons is generated by continuous snipping.
Show that the area of $P_n$ is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ for
all $n\geq 6$, regardless of how the polygons are snipped.
