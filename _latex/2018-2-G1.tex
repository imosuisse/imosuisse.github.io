Let $ABC$ be a triangle and let $\gamma = \angle ACB$.
Assume that $\gamma /2 < \angle BAC$ and $\gamma/2 < \angle CBA$ hold.
Let $D$ be the point on the side $BC$ such that $\angle BAD = \gamma/2$.
Let $E$ be the point on the side $CA$ such that $\angle EBA = \gamma/2$.
Let furthermore $F$ denote the intersection point of the angle bisector of $\angle ACB$ with the side $AB$.
Prove that $EF + FD = AB$.
