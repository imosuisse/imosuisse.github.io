Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $BC > AC$.
The perpendicular bisector of the segment $AB$ intersects the line $BC$ at $X$ and the line $AC$ at $Y$.
Let $P$ be the projection of $X$ on $AC$ and let $Q$ be the projection of $Y$ on $BC$.
Prove that the line $PQ$ intersects the segment $AB$ at its midpoint.
\emph{Remark:} $P$ being the projection of $X$ on $AC$ means that
$P$ lies on the line $AC$ and $PX$ is perpendicular to $AC$.
