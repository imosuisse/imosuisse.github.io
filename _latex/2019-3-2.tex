Let $\mathbb{P}$ be the set of all primes and let $M$ be a subset of $\mathbb{P}$,
having at least three elements, and such that the following property is satisfied:
For any positive integer $k$ and for any subset $A=\{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k\}$ of $M$ with $A\neq M$,
all of the prime factors of the number $p_1\cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k - 1$ are contained in $M$.
Prove that $M=\mathbb{P}$.
