Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB \neq AC$ and $M$ the midpoint of $BC$. The angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ intersects the line $BC$ at $Q$. Let $H$ be the foot of the height of $A$ on $BC$. The perpendicular to $AQ$ through $A$ intersects the line $BC$ in $S$. Show that $MH \cdot QS = AB \cdot AC$ holds.
