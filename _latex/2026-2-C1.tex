    Let $k \leq a \leq b$ be positive integers.
    Ruhi has a sequence of $a + b$ letters that contains $a$ copies of the letter $M$,
    and $b$ copies of the letter $O$.
    She wants the sequence to have exactly $k$ pairs of consecutive letters that form the word $MO$.
    In how many ways can she arrange the letters?
