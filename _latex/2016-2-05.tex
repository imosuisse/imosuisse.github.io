Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB < AC$. The angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ intersects the side $BC$ at $D$. Let $k$ be the circle going through $D$ which is tangent to the sides $AC$ and $AB$ at the points $E$ respectively $F$. Let $G$ be the second point of intersection of $k$ and $BC$ and let $S$ be the point of intersection of the segments $EG$ and $DF$. Prove that $AD$ and $BS$ are perpendicular.
