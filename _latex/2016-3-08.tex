Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with orthocenter $H$. Let $G$ be the intersection of the line parallel to $AB$ through $H$ and the line parallel to $AH$ through $B$. Let $I$ be the point on the line $GH$ such that $AC$ bisects the line $HI$. Let $J$ be the second point of intersection of $AC$ and the circumcircle of the triangle $CGI$. Show that $IJ=AH$ holds.
