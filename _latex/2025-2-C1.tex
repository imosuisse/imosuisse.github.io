Let $n$ be a positive integer.
Pingu the penguin and his $n$ penguin friends are collecting salmon.
Every penguin has at most $n$ salmon, and no two penguins have the same number of salmon.
In how many ways can the $n+1$ penguins split into some number of groups of arbitrary sizes,
such that each group has exactly $n$ total salmon?
