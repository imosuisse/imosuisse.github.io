Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let $l_1$ and $l_2$ be two parallel lines.
For $i=1, 2$, assume $l_i$ meets the lines $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$ at $X_i$, $Y_i$ and $Z_i$ respectively.
Suppose that the line through $X_i$ perpendicular to $BC$, the line through $Y_i$ perpendicular to $CA$,
and finally the line through $Z_i$ perpendicular to $AB$, determine a non-degenerate triangle $\Delta_i$.
Show that the circumcircles of $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ are tangent to each other.
