There are $2012$ chameleons sitting at a round table. At the beginning,
each has the colour red or green. After every full minute, every chameleon that has two
neighbours of the same colour changes its colour from red to green or from green to red.
All others keep their colour. Show that after $2012$ minutes there are at
least $2$ chameleons that have changed colour the same number of times.
