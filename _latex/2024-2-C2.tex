Consider a $2024 \times 2024$ grid, where the $2024$ squares on one of the two diagonals are coloured blue.
Sam writes one of the numbers $1, 2, \dots, 2024^2$ in each of the squares of the grid in such a way that
every number appears exactly once and the squares containing $i-1$ and $i$ share an edge
for any $2 \le i \le 2024^2$. 
Prove there are always two blue squares containing values that differ by exactly $2$.
