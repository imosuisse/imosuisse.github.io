Consider an acute-angled triangle $ABC$ where $U$, $V$, and $W$ are the feet of
the altitudes of $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively, and where the orthocenter is denoted with $H$. 
Let $X$ lie on the segment $AU$, $Y$ on the segment $BV$, and $Z$ on the segment $CW$.
$X,Y$ and $Z$ are all different from $H$. Show that $X,Y,Z$ and $H$ lie on a circle, if and only if
$$[ABC] = [ABZ] + [AYC] + [XBC],$$
where $[PQR]$ denotes the area of the triangle $PQR$.
