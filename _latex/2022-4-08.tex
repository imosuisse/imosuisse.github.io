Johann and Nicole are playing a game on the coordinate plane.
First, Johann draws any polygon $\mathcal{S}$ and then Nicole can shift $\mathcal{S}$ to wherever she wants.
Johann wins if there exists a point with coordinates $(x,y)$ in the interior $\mathcal{S}$,
where $x$ and $y$ are coprime integers.
Otherwise, Nicole wins.
Determine who has a winning strategy.
