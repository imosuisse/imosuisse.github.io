Determine all natural numbers $n$ with the following property:
For any prime $p<n$, $n-\lfloor \frac{n}{p}\rfloor p$ is not divisible by the square of a positive integer greater than $1$.
\emph{Remark:} For $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is defined as the largest integer less than or equal to $x$.
