There are two non-empty stacks of $n$ and $m$ coins respectively on a table.
The following operations are allowed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The same number of coins is removed from both stacks.
    \item The number of coins in a stack is tripled.
\end{itemize}
For which pairs $(n,m)$ is it possible that there are no more coins after a finite number of operations?
