Let $P$ be the set of the first $2009$ prime numbers and let $X$ be the set of all positive
integers that only have prime factors from $P$.
Determine all natural numbers $k$ for which a function $f\colon X \rightarrow X$
exists which fulfils the following equation for all $m,n \in X$:
$$f(mf(n))=f(m)n^k.$$
