Given are $6n$ chips in $2n$ different colours, such that there are exactly $3$ chips of each colour. 
These chips are to be distributed into two piles $A$ and $B$ such that both piles
contain the same number of chips and no pile contains three chips of the same colour.
How many ways are there to do this if
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] the order of the chips within the stacks does not matter?
    \item[b)] the order is important?
\end{enumerate}
