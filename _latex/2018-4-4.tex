Let $n$ be an even positive integer.
We partition the numbers $1,2,\ldots,n^2$ into two sets $A$ and $B$ with the same size
such that all of the $n^2$ numbers belong to exactly one of the two sets.
Let $S_A$ and $S_B$ be the sum of all the elements in $A$ respectively $B$.
Determine all $n$ such that there is a partition with
$$\frac{S_A}{S_B} = \frac{39}{64}.$$
