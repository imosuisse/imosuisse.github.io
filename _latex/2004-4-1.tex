Let $S$ be the set of all $n$-tuples $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$, where $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are subsets of
$\{1,2,\ldots,1000\}$, not all of which have to be different, and which can also be empty.
For $a = (X_1,\ldots,X_n) \in S$ denote
$$E(a) = \text{ number of elements of } X_1 \cup \ldots \cup X_n.$$
Find an explicit expression for the sum
$$\sum_{a \in S} E(a).$$
