Given a (simple) graph $G$ with $n\geq 2$ vertices $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ and $m\geq 1$ edges,
Joël and Robert play the following game with $m$ coins:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Joël first assigns to each vertex $v_i$ a non-negative integer $w_i$ such that $w_1 + \dots + w_n = m$.
    \item Robert then chooses a (possibly empty) subset of edges,
and for each edge chosen he places a coin on exactly one of its two endpoints,
and then removes that edge from the graph.
When he is done, the amount of coins on each vertex $v_i$ should not be greater than $w_i$. 
    \item Joël then does the same for all the remaining edges.
    \item Joël wins if the number of coins on each vertex $v_i$ is equal to $w_i$.
\end{enumerate}
Determine all graphs $G$ for which Joël has a winning strategy.
