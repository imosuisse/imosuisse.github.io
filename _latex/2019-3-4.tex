Let $n$ be a positive integer.
We place $n+1$ bowls in a row and number them from left to right by the numbers $0,1,\ldots,n$.
In the beginning, $n$ stones lie in bowl $0$ and no stone lies in any of the other bowls.
Sisyphus wants to move all $n$ stones to bowl $n$.
To do this, in one step Sisyphus moves exactly one stone from a bowl containing $k\geq 1$ stones 
at most $k$ bowls to the right.
Let $T$ be the minimal number of steps which Sisyphus needs to move all stones to bowl $n$.
Show that:
$$T\geq \left\lceil \frac{n}{1} \right\rceil + \left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil
+ \ldots + \left\lceil \frac{n}{n} \right\rceil.$$

\textit{Remark:} As usual, $\lceil x \rceil$ stands for the least integer larger than or equal to $x$.
