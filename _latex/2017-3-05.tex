Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AC > AB$.
Let $P$ be the intersection of $BC$ and the tangent to the circumcircle of $ABC$ through $A$.
Let $Q$ be the point on line $AC$ such that $AQ = AB$ and $A$ lays between $C$ and $Q$.
Let $X$ and $Y$ be the midpoints of $BQ$ and $AP$, respectively.
Let $R$ be the point on $AP$ such that $AR=BP$ and $R$ lays between $A$ and $P$.
Show that $BR = 2XY$.
