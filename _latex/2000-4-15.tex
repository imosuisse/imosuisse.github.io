Let $S=\{P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_{2000}\}$ be a set of $2000$ points inside a circle of radius $1$
where one of the points is the centre of the circle.
For $i=1,2,\ldots,2000$ let $x_i$ denote the distance from $P_i$ to the nearest
point $P_j \neq P_i$ in $S$. Show that
$$x_1^2+x_2^2+\ldots+x_{2000}^2 < 9.$$
