Let $n$ be a natural integer and $G$ be the set of points $(x,y)$ in the plane
such that $x$ and $y$ are integers with $1\leq x,y\leq n$.
A subset of $G$ is called \textit{parallelogramfree} if it does not contain four
non-collinear points that are the vertices of a parallelogram.
How many points at most can a parallelogramfree subset contain?
