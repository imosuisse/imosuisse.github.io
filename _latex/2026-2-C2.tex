Mark has $20$ bookshelves of heights $1, 1, 2, 2,  \dots, 10, 10$,
where two bookshelves of the same height are indistinguishable.
He wants to place them in a line in such a way that his cat can jump from one bookshelf to the next,
starting on the leftmost bookshelf and ending on the rightmost bookshelf.
His cat is lazy and has two conditions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exactly one of the cat's nineteen jumps is from a bookshelf to a strictly taller bookshelf.
    \item Between two bookshelves of the same height, no strictly taller bookshelf can be placed.
\end{itemize}
In how many ways can Mark place his bookshelves satisfying both conditions?
