Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral and let $P$ and $Q$ be points inside the
quadrilateral $ABCD$ such that $PQDA$ and $QPBC$ are cyclic quadrilaterals.
Assume that a point $E$ exists on the line $PQ$ such that $\angle PAE=\angle QDE$ and
$\angle PBE=\angle QCE$. Show that $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
