There are $924$ fans of the Liechtenstein football team from either Liechtenstein or Switzerland who
have gathered to get the autographs of their favourite players.
There are $11$ players on the team, and every fan has exactly $6$ favourite players.
No two people from a given country share the same group of favourites,
and in the end everyone got exactly one autograph from one of their favourite players.
Show that there is a player who gave an autograph to both a Swiss and a Liechtensteiner person.
