Let $D$ be a point inside an acute triangle $ABC$ such that $\angle BAD= \angle DBC$ and $\angle DAC=\angle BCD$.
Let $P$ be a point on the circumcircle of triangle $ADB$.
We assume that $P$ lies outside of the triangle $ABC$.
A line through $P$ intersects the ray $BA$ in $X$ and the ray $CA$ in $Y$ such that $\angle XPB=\angle PDB$.
Prove that $BY$ and $CX$ intersect on $AD$.

\textit{Remark:} For two points $F$ and $G$,
the ray $FG$ is the set of points on the line $FG$ that lies on the same side of $F$ than $G$.
