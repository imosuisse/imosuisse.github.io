Let $n$ be a positive integer.
A volleyball team consisting of $n$ men and $n$ women is preparing to play.
Every player is assigned one of the positions $1,2,\ldots,2n$
of which exactly the positions $1$ and $n+1$ lie outside the court.
During the game, the players rotate in such a way that
the player on position $i$ switches to position $i+1$ (respectively from position $2n$ to $1$).
In how many ways can the positions initially be assigned so that
there are always at least $n-1$ women on the court, no matter how many rotations have occured?

\emph{Remark:} Two initial positions are different,
if at least one player is assigned to two different positions.
