Let $\alpha$ be a real number satisfying $0 < \alpha < 180$.
For Leo's birthday, Frieder has placed $2025$ gnomes at arbitrary points inside his garden.
No three gnomes are collinear and no two gnomes coincide.
Each gnome has a field of view spanning $\alpha$ degrees (including the boundary).
After Frieder places the gnomes down, Leo wants to rotate the gnomes such that, for each gnome,
the number of other gnomes it sees is different.
Determine all values of $\alpha$ for which Leo can achieve this, regardless of how the gnomes are placed.
