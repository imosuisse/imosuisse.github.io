Let $\Gamma$ be a circle and $P$ a point outside $\Gamma$.
A tangent from $P$ to the circle touches it at $A$. Another straight line through $P$
intersects $\Gamma$ at the different points $B$ and $C$. The bisector of $APB$ intersects
$AB$ at $D$ and $AC$ at $E$. Prove that the triangle $ADE$ is isosceles.
