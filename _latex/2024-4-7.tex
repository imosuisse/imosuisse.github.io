Let $m,n \geq 2$ be integers.
On each unit square of a $m \times n$ grid there is a coin.
Initially all coins show heads. Jérôme repeatedly performs the following operation.
First, he selects a $2 \times 2$ square within the grid and then does one of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flipping all coins in the chosen $2 \times 2$ square except the top-right one.
    \item Flipping all coins in the chosen $2 \times 2$ square except the bottom-left one.
\end{itemize}
Determine all pairs $(m,n)$ for which, at some point, Jérôme can make all coins show tails at the same time.
