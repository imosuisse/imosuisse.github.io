For a finite set $A$ of positive integers, we call a division into two disjoint
non-empty subsets $A_1$ and $A_2$ \emph{demonic} if the least common
multiple of $A_1$ is equal to the greatest common divisor of $A_2$.
Determine the minimum number of elements in $A$ such that there are exactly $2016$ demonic splits.
