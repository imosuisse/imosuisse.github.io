Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle, and $I$ its incenter.
Let $A_1$ be the intersection of $AI$ and $BC$, and $C_1$ the intersection of $CI$ and $AB$.
Furthermore, let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $AI$ and $CI$, respectively.
Inside the triangles $AC_1I$ and $A_1CI$ we choose points $K$ and $L$
such that $\angle AKI = \angle CLI = \angle AIC$, $\angle AKM = \angle ICA$ and $\angle CLN = \angle IAC$.
Prove that the radii of the circumcircles of the triangles $KIL$ and $ABC$ are equal.
