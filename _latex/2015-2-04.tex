Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle and $W$ the intersection of the angle bisector of $\angle ACB$ and the side $AB$. Furthermore, let $I_A$ and $I_B$ be the incenters of the triangles $AWC$ and $WBC$ respectively. The lines $I_AW$ and $I_BB$ intersect at point $D$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the line $DI_B$.
Show that $MWBC$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.

\emph{Note:} The three angle bisectors of a triangle intersect at a point, the centre of the inscribed circle.
