There are $16$ secret agents working in Geneva. Each agent monitors at least one other agent,
but no two agents monitor each other. Assume that for any $10$ agents,
they can be numbered in such a way that the first agent monitors the second,
the second the third and so on, and the tenth the first. Show that for any $11$ agents,
they can also be numbered in such a way that each agent monitors the next.
