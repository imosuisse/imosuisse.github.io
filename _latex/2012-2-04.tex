Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots$ be an arithmetic sequence of integers.
Assume that for $1\leq k\leq 50$ each $a_k$ is divisible by $k$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] Prove that $a_{51}$ is divisible by $51$ and $a_{52}$ is divisible by $52$.
    \item[b)] Is $a_{53}$ always divisible by $53$?
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Remark:} The sequence $a_1,a_2,\ldots$ is arithmetic if the difference $a_{i+1}-a_i$ is the same for all $i$.
