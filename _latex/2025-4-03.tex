Let $\Omega$ be a circle and $\omega$ a circle inside $\Omega$.
Point $A$ lies on $\Omega$, and tangents to $\omega$ through $A$ touch $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$.
Let line $BC$ intersect $\Omega$ at points $X$ and $Y$.
Let $K, L$ and $M$ be the midpoints of $BC, AX$ and $AY$ respectively.
The circumcircle of $XLK$ intersects $\omega$ at two points $P_1$ and $P_2$,
such that $P_1$ lies on the same side of $BC$ as $A$.
Similarly, the circumcircle of $YMK$ intersects $\omega$ at two points $Q_1$ and $Q_2$,
such that $Q_1$ lies on the same side of $BC$ as $A$.
If lines $P_1Q_1$ and $P_2Q_2$ intersect at $R$, prove that $RA$ is tangent to $\Omega$.
