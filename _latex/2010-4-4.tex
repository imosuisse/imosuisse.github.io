The points $X,Y,Z$ lie in this order on a line with $|XY| \neq |YZ|$. Let $k_1$ and $k_2$ be
the circles with diameter $XY$ and $YZ$ respectively. The points $A_1$ and $B_1$ respectively
$A_2$ and $B_2$ lie on $k_1$ and $k_2$ respectively, such that
$$\angle A_1YA_2 = \angle B_1YB_2 = 90^\circ$$
holds. Show that the two lines $A_1A_2$ and $B_1B_2$ intersect on $XY$.
