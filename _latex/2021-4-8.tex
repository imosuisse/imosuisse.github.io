Let $ABC$ be a triangle such that $BC = CA$.
Let $D$ be a point inside the segment $AB$ such that $AD<DB$.
Let $P$ and $Q$ be two points inside the segments $BC$ and $CA$ respectively
such that $\angle DPB = \angle DQA = 90^\circ$.
Let the perpendicular bisector of $PQ$ intersect the segment $CQ$ at $E$.
The circumcircles of $ABC$ and $PQC$ intersect at $C$ and $F$.
Suppose that $P, E, F$ are collinear.
Prove that $\angle ACB=90^\circ$.
