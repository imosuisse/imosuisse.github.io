Let $n\geq 3$ be an integer.
Annalena has infinitely many cowbells in each of $n$ different colours.
Given an integer $m \ge n+1$ and a group of $m$ cows standing in a circle,
she is tasked with tying one cowbell around the neck of every cow so that
every group of $n+1$ consecutive cows have cowbells of all the possible $n$ colours.
Prove that there are only finitely many values of $m$ for which this is not possible
and determine the largest such $m$ in terms of $n$.
