Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle ABC \neq \angle BCA$.
The incircle $k$ of the triangle $ABC$ touches the sides $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$ at the
points $D$, $E$ and $F$ respectively. The line $AD$ intersects $k$ once more at $P$.
Let $Q$ be the intersection of $EF$ with the line perpendicular to $AD$ through $P$.
Let $X$ and $Y$ be the intersections of $AQ$ with $DE$ and $DF$ respectively.
Show that $A$ is the midpoint of the line $XY$.
