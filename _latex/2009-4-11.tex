Consider $n$ collinear points $P_1, \ldots, P_n$ and all circles with
diameter $P_iP_j$ for $1 \leq i < j \leq n$. Each of these circles is coloured with
one of $k$ colours. Such a set of coloured circles is called an $(n,k)$-\emph{cluster}.
A \emph{monochromatic eight} is two circles of the same colour that touch each other
tangentially on the outside. Show that every possible $(n,k)$-cluster contains a
monochromatic eight if and only if $n>2^k$ holds.
