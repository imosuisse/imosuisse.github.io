In a garden, there are $2023$ rose bushes planted in a row.
Each bush contains either red or blue roses.
Vicky is taking a walk and wants to pick some of the flowers.
She starts at a bush of her choice, and picks a rose from it to add to her basket.
She then continues walking down the row and picks a single flower from each bush she visits.
Vicky can skip some bushes, but she cannot skip two adjacent bushes.
She can leave the garden at any point.
Let $r$ and $b$ be the number of red and blue roses she picked, respectively.
Determine the maximal value of $|r-b|$ Vicky can achieve, irrespective of the configuration of bushes.
