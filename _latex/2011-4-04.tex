Let $n$ be a natural number. There are $n$ vertical bars and $n$ monkeys, one at the bottom of each bar.
To give the monkeys some exercise, the keepers place a banana at the top of each pole for feeding.
In addition, they connect the poles with a finite number of ropes such that two different rope ends
are attached to different points. No two rope ends are attached to the same point.
Now all the monkeys climb upwards, and whenever they encounter one end of a rope,
they climb across it to its other end and continue upwards from there.
Prove that regardless of how the ropes are placed, each monkey will get exactly one banana.
