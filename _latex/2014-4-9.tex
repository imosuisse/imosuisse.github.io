Let $n$ be a positive integer. The FÃ¼rst of Liechtenstein wants to connect the $n$ cities of
his country with $n-1$ roads, such that the following holds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item You can drive from any city to any other city along the $n-1$ roads.
    \item No city is on more than two roads.
    \item No two roads cross each other.
\end{itemize}
Show that the number of possibilities the president has to build the roads is minimal
if and only if the $n$ cities form a convex $n$-gon.
