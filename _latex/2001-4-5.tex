Let $a_1<a_2< \ldots <a_n$ be a sequence of positive integers with the property that
for $i<j$ the decimal representation of $a_j$ does not start with that of $a_i$
(for example, the numbers $137$ and $13729$ cannot both occur in the sequence).
Prove that
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{a_i} \leq \frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\ldots+\frac{1}{9}$$
