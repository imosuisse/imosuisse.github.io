Let $A, B, C, D, E$ be five points lying on a circle in this order,
such that $AE$ is a diameter and $BC > CD$.
Let $F$ be the intersection of $AD$ and $BE$.
Let $O$ be the circumcenter of the triangle $BFD$.
Let the reflection of the line $BD$ across $BC$ and
the reflection of the line $BD$ across $DC$ intersect at $Y$. 

Prove that $\angle OYC = 90^\circ$.
