Let $p\geq 2$ be a prime number.
Arnaud and Louis alternatively choose an index $i\in \{0,1,\ldots,p-1\}$
that has not already been chosen and a digit $a_i\in\{0,1,\ldots,9\}$.
Arnaud starts.
Once every index has been chosen, they compute the following sum:
$$a_0+a_1\cdot 10+\ldots+a_{p-1}\cdot 10^{p-1}=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}a_i\cdot 10^i.$$
If the sum is divisible by $p$, Arnaud wins.
Otherwise Louis wins.
Prove that Arnaud has a winning strategy.
