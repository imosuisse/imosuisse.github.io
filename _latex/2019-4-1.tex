Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $D$, $E$, $F$ be the feet of the altitudes from $A$, $B$, $C$, respectively.
Let $H$ be the orthocenter of triangle $ABC$.
The segments $EF$ and $AD$ intersect at $G$.
Let $K$ be the point on the circumcircle of $ABC$ such that $AK$ is a diameter of this circle.
The line $AK$ intersects $BC$ at $M$.
Prove that the lines $GM$ and $HK$ are parallel.
