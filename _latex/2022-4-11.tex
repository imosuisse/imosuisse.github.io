Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer.
Each of the squares of an $n \times n$ board contains a bit-coin with $0$ on one side, $1$ on the other.
Initially, all bit-coins in the leftmost column show a $0$.
A move consists of one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Within any row, look at the rightmost two neighbouring bit-coins that display different numbers
    (if they exist) and flip both of these as well as all bit-coins to their right.
    \item Within any column, look at the topmost two neighbouring bit-coins that display different numbers
    (if they exist) and flip both of these as well as all bit-coins above them.
\end{itemize}
Find the minimal value of $k$ such that there always exists a sequence of moves resulting in
at most $k$ bit-coins showing $1$.
