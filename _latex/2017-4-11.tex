Let $B=(-1,0)$ and $C=(1,0)$ be fixed points in the plane. A non-empty, bounded subset $S$
of the plane is called \emph{kind} if the following conditions are met:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a point $T$ in $S$ such that for each other point $Q$ in $S$, the segment $TQ$ is
    completely inside $S$.
    \item For each triangle $P_1P_2P_3$, there exists a unique point $A$ in $S$ and a permutation
    $\sigma$ of $\{1, 2, 3\}$ such that the triangles $ABC$ and
    $P_{\sigma(1)}P_{\sigma(2)}P_{\sigma(3)}$ are similar.
\end{itemize}
Show that there are two kind subsets $S$ and $S'$ of the set $\{(x,y):x\geq 0,y\geq 0\}$ with the
property that the product $BA\cdot BA'$ is independent of the triangle $P_1P_2P_3$, where $A\in S$
and $A'\in S'$ are the points guaranteed by the second condition above for the arbitrary triangle
$P_1P_2P_3$.
