Let $n$ be a positive integer.
A group of $n$ penguins swim in $n$ races,
in each of which they are ranked from $1$st to $n$th position with no draws.
A penguin is eligible for a rating $(a,b)$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$,
if in at least $a$ races they finished in any of the first $b$ positions.
Their final score is the maximum possible value $a-b$ across all ratings for which they are eligible.
Find the maximum possible sum of all scores of the $n$ penguins.
