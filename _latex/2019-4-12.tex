Define the sequence $(a_n)_{n\geq 0}$ of integers by $a_n:=2^n+2^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}$.
Prove that there are infinitely many terms of the sequence which can be expressed as
a sum of two or more distinct terms of the sequence,
as well as infinitely many terms which cannot be expressed in such a way.
