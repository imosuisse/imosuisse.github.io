Let $k$ be a positive integer. Leo owns an empty garden that measures $45$ by $45$ units.
He wants to plant flowers in each of the $2025$ unit squares, and can plant one square with flowers each morning.
However, whenever flowers are planted in a square, then $k$ days later in the evening,
any orthogonally adjacent empty square will become infested with weeds.
Infested squares can no longer have flowers planted in them.
Find the minimum value of $k$ such that Leo can plant his entire garden with flowers.
