For each prime $p$, somewhere in the multiverse there exists a kingdom consisting of $p$ islands
numbered from $1$ to $p$ with a bridge between any pair of them.
When Jana visits a kingdom, coronavirus restrictions mean she must obey the following rule:
Directly after visiting island $m$, she can only cross over to island $n$ if 
$$p \div (m^2-n+1)(n^2-m+1).$$
Show that there are infinitely many kingdoms such that Jana cannot travel to every island in this manner.
