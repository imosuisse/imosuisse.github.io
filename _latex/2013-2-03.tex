We call a positive integer \emph{likeable} if the digits of its decimal representation fulfill the following two conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each of the digits $0,1,\ldots, 9$ occurs at most once.
    \item If $A$ is an even digit and $B$ is an odd digit, then there are exactly
    $\frac{A+B-1}{2}$ other digits between $A$ and $B$.
\end{itemize}
Determine the number of likeable numbers.
