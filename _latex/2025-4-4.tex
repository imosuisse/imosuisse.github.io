Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB < AC$.
Denote its circumcircle by $\Omega$, its circumcenter by $O$, and its incenter by $I$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of the arc $BC$ not containing $A$.
Line $OI$ meets $\Omega$ at $E$ and $F$, and line $BC$ meets $ME$ and $MF$ at $K$ and $L$, respectively.
Suppose that $IA = IM$.
Prove that $IKML$ is a rectangle.
