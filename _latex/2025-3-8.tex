Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AB=AC$.
Let $D$ and $E$ be points on the segments $AB$ and $AC$, respectively.
Let $\omega_1$ be the circle with center $D$ and radius $DB$ and let $\omega_2$ be the circle
with center $E$ and radius $EC$.
Assume that $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect twice and let $P$ be the intersection closest to $BC$.
Denote by $F \neq B$ and $G \neq C$ the intersections of $BC$ with $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, respectively.
Finally, let $DF$ and $EG$ intersect in $Q$, and let the angle bisectors of $QDP$ and $PEQ$ intersect in $S$.
Show that the circumcircles of $SDQ$ and $SEP$ are tangent.
