Consider three faces of an $n\times n \times n$ cube that meet at one of the corners of the cube.
For which $n$ is it possible to cover them completely and without overlapping with strips
of paper of size $3\times 1$?

\emph{Remark:} The paper strips can also be glued over the edges between these cube faces.
