Let $ABC$ be a non-right-angled triangle and $M$ the midpoint of $BC$. Let $D$ be a point on $AB$ such that $CA=CD$ and $E$ a point on $BC$ such that $EB=ED$. The line parallel to $ED$ through $A$ intersects the line $MD$ at point $I$ and the lines $AM$ and $ED$ intersect at point $J$. Show that the points $C$, $I$ and $J$ lie on a line.
