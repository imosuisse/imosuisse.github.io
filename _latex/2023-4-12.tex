For a positive integer $m$, we denote by $[m]$ the set $\{1, 2, \dots, m\}$.
Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $\mathcal{S}$ be a non-empty collection of subsets of $[n]$.
A function $f\colon [n] \to [n+1]$ is called \emph{kawaii} if
there exists $A \in \mathcal{S}$ such that for all $B \in \mathcal{S}$ with $A \neq B$ we have 
$$\sum_{a \in A} f(a) > \sum_{b \in B} f(b).$$
Prove that there are always at least $n^n$ \emph{kawaii} functions, irrespective of $\mathcal{S}$.
