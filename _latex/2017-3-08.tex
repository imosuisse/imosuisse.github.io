Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB = AC$ and $AB > BC$.
Let $k$ be the circle with center $A$ through $B$ and $C$.
Let $H$ be the second intersection of $k$ with the altitude of $ABC$ though $B$.
Further, let $G$ be the second intersection of $k$ with the median of $ABC$ through $B$.
Let $X$ be the intersection of $AC$ and $GH$.
Show that $C$ is the midpoint of the segment $AX$.
