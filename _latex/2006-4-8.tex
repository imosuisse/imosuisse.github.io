The numbers $1,2,\ldots,2006$ are placed arbitrarily on a circle.
Two neighbouring numbers on the circle can now be swapped repeatedly.
After a sequence of such swaps, each of the numbers is diametrically opposed to its starting position.
Prove that, at least once, two numbers with sum $2007$ have been swapped.
