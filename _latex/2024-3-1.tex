If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers,
we say that $a$ \emph{almost divides} $b$ if $a$ divides at least one of $b-1$ and $b+1$.
We call a positive integer $n$ \emph{almost prime} if the following holds:
for any positive integers $a$, $b$ such that $n$ almost divides $ab$,
we have that $n$ almost divides at least one of $a$ and $b$.
Determine all almost prime numbers.
