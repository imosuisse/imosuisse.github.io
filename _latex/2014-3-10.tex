Let $k$ be a circle with diameter $AB$. Let $C$ be a point on the line $AB$ such
that $B$ lies between $A$ and $C$. Let $T$ be a point on $k$ such that $CT$ is a tangent to $k$.
Let $l$ be the parallel to $CT$ through $A$ and let $D$ be the intersection of $l$ and
the perpendicular to $AB$ through $T$. Show that the line $DB$ bisects the segment $CT$.
