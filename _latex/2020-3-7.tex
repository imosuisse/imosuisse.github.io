Let $ABCD$ be an isoceles trapezoid with $AD>BC$.
Let $X$ be the intersection point of the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ and $BC$.
Let $E$ be the intersection point of $DB$ with the parallel to the angle bisector of $\angle CBD$ through $X$
and let $F$ be the intersection point of $DC$ and the parallel to the angle bisector of $\angle DCB$ through $X$.
Prove that $AEFD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
