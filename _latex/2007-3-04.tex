Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AB>AC$ and orthocenter $H$.
Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude of $A$ on $BC$. Let $E$ be the reflection of $C$ at $D$.
The lines $AE$ and $BH$ intersect at the point $S$.
Let $N$ be the midpoint of $AE$ and let $M$ be the midpoint of $BH$.
Prove that $MN$ is perpendicular to $DS$.
