Consider a $8 \times 8$ board.
An \emph{inner edge} is an edge that separates two $1 \times 1$ squares.
We cut the board into multiple $1 \times 2$ domino stones.
For an inner edge $k$, denote by $N(k)$ the number of possible ways to cut the board such that
we cut along $k$.
Determine the last digit of the sum we obtain when adding the $N(k)$ for all inner edges $k$.
