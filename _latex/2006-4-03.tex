Let $n$ be a positive integer. Each of the numbers $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ is coloured white or black.
One can now repeatedly select a number and recolour it as well as all numbers that are not divisors of it.
Initially all numbers are white. For which $n$ can you achieve that all numbers are black at some point?
