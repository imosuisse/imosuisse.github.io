Each vertex of a regular $2n$-gon ($n \geq 3$) is labelled with a distinct number
from the set $\{1,2,\ldots,2n\}$ in such a way that the sum of the numbers of neighbouring
vertices is always equal to the sum of the numbers in the two diametrically opposite vertices.
Show that this is possible if and only if $n$ is odd.
