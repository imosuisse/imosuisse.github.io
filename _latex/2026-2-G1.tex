Let $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ be two circles intersecting at the points $X$ and $Y$.
Let $\ell$ be a line intersecting $\Gamma_1$ at points $A$ and $C$,
and intersecting $\Gamma_2$ at points $B$ and $D$,
such that $A, B, C, D$ lie on $\ell$ in this order.
Let $P$ be the intersection of $XA$ and $YB$, and $Q$ be the intersection of $XD$ and $YC$. 

Prove that $PQ$ is parallel to $\ell$.
