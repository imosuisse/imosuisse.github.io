Let $ABC$ be a triangle. The points $K, L$ and $M$ lie on the sides $BC, CA$ and $AB$ such that the lines $AK, BL$ and $CM$ intersect at a point. Show that you can choose two of the triangles $AML, BKM$ and $CLK$ such that the sum of their incircle radii is at least as large as the incircle radius of triangle $ABC$.
