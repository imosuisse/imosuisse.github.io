Let $n\geq 2$ be an integer.
Consider an $n\times n$ chessboard with the usual chessboard colouring.
A move consists of choosing a $1\times 1$ square and switching the colour of all squares in its row and column
(including the chosen square itself).
For which $n$ is it possible to get a monochrome chessboard after a finite sequence of moves?
