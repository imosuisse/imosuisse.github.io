The icy ballroom of the White Witch is shaped like a square,
and the floor is covered by $n \times n$ identical square tiles.
Additionally, between some pairs of adjacent tiles there are magic edges.
The White Witch's loyal servant Edmund is tasked with cleaning the ballroom.
He starts in one of the corner tiles and may move up, down, left and right.
However, as the floor is slippery, he will slide in that direction until he hits a wall or a magic edge.
On the upside, he is wearing special shoes that clean each tile he passes over.
Determine the minimum number of magic edges that need to be placed for Edmund to be able to clean all the tiles.
