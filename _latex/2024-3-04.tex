Determine the maximal length $L$ of a sequence $a_1, \dots, a_L$ of positive integers satisfying
both of the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item every term in the sequence is less than or equal to $2^{2024}$, and
    \item there does not exist a consecutive subsequence $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$
    (where $1 \le i \le j \le L$) with a choice of signs $s_i, s_{i+1}, \dots, s_j \in \{1,-1\}$ for which
    $$s_ia_i + s_{i+1}a_{i+1} + \dots + s_ja_j = 0.$$
\end{itemize}
