Let $n \geq 4$ be an integer and let $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ and $b_1, \ldots, b_n$ be sequences
of positive integers such that the $n+1$ products
\begin{align*}
a_1a_2 & \cdots a_{n-1}a_n, \\
b_1a_2 & \cdots a_{n-1}a_n, \\
b_1b_2 & \cdots a_{n-1}a_n, \\
 & \; \; \vdots \\
b_1b_2 & \cdots b_{n-1}a_n, \\
b_1b_2 & \cdots b_{n-1}b_n,
\end{align*}
taken in this order, form a strictly increasing arithmetic progression.
Determine the smallest possible common difference of this arithmetic progression in terms of $n$.
\emph{Remark:} An arithmetic progression is a sequence of the form $a, a+r, a+2r, \ldots, a+kr$
where $a$, $r$ and $k$ are integers and $r$ is called the common difference.
