Let $A$ and $B$ be the intersection points of two circles $k$ and $l$ with centre $K$ and $L$ respectively.
Let $M$ and $N$ be the intersection points of $k$ and $l$ respectively with a
line through $A$ such that $A$ lies between $M$ and $N$. 
Let $D$ be the intersection of the lines $MK$ and $NL$. 
Show that the points $M,N,B$ and $D$ lie on a circle.
