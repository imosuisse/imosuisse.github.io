There are $n\geq 4$ towns on a round lake, between which $n-4$ passenger ferries and a
green car ferry operate. Each ferry connects two non-adjacent cities, with no two ferry routes
crossing each other to avoid collisions. The following change can be made to better adapt the
transport routes to the needs of passengers: A new route can be assigned to any ferry.
The routes of the other ferries may not be crossed or changed at the same time.
Let Santa Marta and Cape Town be two non-neighboring cities.
Show that you can make a finite number of route changes such that the green car ferry
runs between Santa Marta and Cape Town after these changes.
\emph{Remark:} At no time may two ferries run between the same
cities or one ferry run between two neighboring cities.
