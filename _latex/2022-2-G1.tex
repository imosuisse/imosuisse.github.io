Let $k$ be a circle centred at $O$ and let $X,A,Y$ be three points on $k$ in this order such that
the tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $OXA$ through $X$ and
the tangent to the circumcircle of $OAY$ through $Y$ are parallel.
Show that $\angle XAY = 120^\circ$ if $A$ lies on the minor arc $XY$.

\emph{Remark:} The minor arc $XY$ is the shorter arc of the circle $k$ linking $X$ and $Y$.
