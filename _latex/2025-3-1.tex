Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral without parallel sides.
Let points $X$ and $Y$ lie on $DA$ such that $BX \parallel CD$ and $CY \parallel AB$.
Let $Z$ be the intersection of $BX$ and $CY$, and $M$ be the midpoint of the segment $BC$. 
Prove that $MZ$ is perpendicular to the line joining the circumcenters of triangles $ABX$ and $CDY$.
