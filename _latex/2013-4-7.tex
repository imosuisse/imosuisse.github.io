Let $n \ge 2$ be a natural number. An $n \times n$ board is completely
covered with $2\times 2$ squares. The $2 \times 2$ squares consist of two diagonally opposite
black unit squares and two diagonally opposite white unit squares.
The $2\times 2$ squares can be rotated and they can also overlap,
but they must lie completely on the $n\times n$ board. What is the minimum
number of black squares visible in such a covering?
