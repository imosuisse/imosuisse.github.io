Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle BAC = 60^\circ$. Find all points $P$ in the interior of
this triangle with the following property:
If $D$ is the projection of $P$ onto the line $BC$, $E$ is the projection of $P$ onto
$CA$ and $F$ is the projection of $P$ onto $AB$, then $\angle EDF = 30^\circ$.
