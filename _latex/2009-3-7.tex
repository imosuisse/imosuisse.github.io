The points $A$, $M_1$, $M_2$ and $C$ lie on a line in this order.
Let $k_1$ be the circle with centre $M_1$ through $A$ and $k_2$ the circle
with centre $M_2$ through $C$. The two circles intersect at the points $E$ and $F$.
A common tangent to $k_1$ and $k_2$ touches $k_1$ in $B$ and $k_2$ in $D$.
Show that the lines $AB$, $CD$ and $EF$ intersect at a point.
