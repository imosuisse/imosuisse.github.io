We call two people a \emph{friended pair} if they know each other, and we call
them a \emph{unfriended pair} if they do not know each other (being friends or not
being friends is always mutual). Let $m,n$ be natural numbers.
Find the smallest natural number $k$ such that the following holds:
In every group of $k$ people, there are always $2m$ people who form $m$ disjoint friendly pairs,
or there are $2n$ people who form $n$ disjoint non-friend pairs.
