Consider a $7 \times 7$ field that is divided into $49$ unit squares.
We want to place tiles in the shape of a Swiss cross, consisting of $5$ unit squares, in this field.
The borders of the crosses should lie on the lines of the field.
Determine the smallest possible number of squares that must be marked on the field so
that each cross, no matter where it is placed on the field, covers at least one marked square.
