Let $k_1$ and $k_2$ be two circles touching each other externally at point $P$.
Let a third circle $k$ touch $k_1$ in $B$ and $k_2$ in $C$ so that $k_1$ and $k_2$ lie inside $k$.
Let $A$ be one of the intersection points of $k$ with the common
tangent of $k_1$ and $k_2$ through $P$.
The lines $AB$ and $AC$ intersect $k_1$ and $k_2$ again in $R$ and $S$ respectively.
Show that $RS$ is a common tangent of $k_1$ and $k_2$.
