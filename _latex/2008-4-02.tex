Let $m,n$ be natural numbers. Consider a square grid of $(2m+1) \times (2n+1)$ points in the plane.
A set of rectangles is called \emph{good} if the following holds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each of the rectangles, the four vertices lie on grid points and
    the sides are parallel to the grid lines.
    \item No two of the rectangles have a common corner point.
\end{itemize}
Determine the largest possible value of the sum of the areas of all rectangles in a good set.
