Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle BCA = 90^\circ$ and $H$ the base of the altitude of $C$. Let $D$ be a point inside the triangle $BCH$ such that $CH$ bisects the distance $AD$. Let $P$ be the intersection of the lines $BD$ and $CH$. Let $\omega$ be the semicircle with diameter $BD$ that intersects the line $CB$. The tangent of $P$ to $\omega$ touches it at $Q$. Show that the intersection of the lines $CQ$ and $AD$ lies on $\omega$.
