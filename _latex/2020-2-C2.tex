The village of Roche has $2020$ residents.
One day, the famous mathematician Georges de Rham makes the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every villager knows someone else with the same age as them.
    \item For any group of $192$ people in the village,
    there are always at least three of them that have the same age.
\end{itemize}
Prove that there must exist a group of $22$ villagers that all have the same age.
