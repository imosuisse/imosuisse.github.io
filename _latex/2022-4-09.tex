Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle $\Omega$.
Let the tangent to $\Omega$ at $D$ intersect the rays $BA$ and $BC$ at points $E$ and $F$, respectively.
A point $T$ is chosen inside the triangle $ABC$ so that $TE$ is parallel to $CD$ and $TF$ is parallel to $AD$.
Let $K\neq D$ be a point on the segment $DF$ such that $TD=TK$.
Prove that the lines $AC$, $DT$ and $BK$ intersect at one point.
