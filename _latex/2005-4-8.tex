Consider a lake with two islands in it and seven cities on the shore.
We will call the islands and cities \emph{places} for short.
There is a ship connection which connects exactly the following pairs of places
\begin{itemize}
    \item between the two islands,
    \item between each city and each island,
    \item between two cities only if they are not neighbouring.
\end{itemize}
Each of these connections is offered by exactly one of two competing transport companies.
Prove that there are always three places such that there are ship connections
of the same company between every two of these places.
