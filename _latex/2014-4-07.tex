Two circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ touch tangentially at a point $A$ and lie inside a circle $\Omega$.
Furthermore, $\omega_1$ touches $\Omega$ tangentially at a point $B$ and $\omega_2$ touches
$\Omega$ tangentially at a point $C$. The line $AC$ intersects $\omega_1$ a second time at a point $D$.
Show that the triangle $DBC$ is right-angled if $A$, $B$ and $C$ are not collinear.
