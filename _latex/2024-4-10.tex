Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AC>BC$.
Let $\omega$ be the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ and let $r$ be the radius of $\omega$.
Let point $P$ lie on the segment $AC$ such that $BC=CP$ and
let $S$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to line $AB$.
Let the line $BP$ intersect $\omega$ again at $D \neq B$.
Let $Q$ lie on line $SP$ such that $PQ=r$ and such that $S$, $P$ and $Q$ lie on the line in that order.
Finally, let the line perpendicular to $CQ$ from $A$ intersect the line perpendicular to $DQ$ from $B$ at $E$.
Prove that $E$ lies on $\omega$.
