There are $2n$ different points on a circle.
The numbers $1$ to $2n$ are arbitrarily assigned to these points.
Each point is connected to exactly one other point by a straight line, and
none of these lines intersect.
If a line connects the numbers $a$ and $b$, we assign the value $|a-b|$ to the line.
Show that we can choose the lines so that the sum of these values is $n^2$.
