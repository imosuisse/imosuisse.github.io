There are $2n$ different points on a circle. The numbers $1$ to $2n$ are randomly distributed over these points. Each point is connected to exactly one other point, such that none of the resulting connecting lines intersect. If a line connects the numbers $a$ and $b$, we assign the value $|a-b|$ to the line. Show that we can choose the lines so that the sum of these values is $n^2$.
