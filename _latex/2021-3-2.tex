Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AB = AC$ and let $D$ be a point on the side $BC$.
The circle with centre $D$ passing through $C$ intersects the circumcircle of $ABD$ in $P$ and $Q$,
where $Q$ is the point closer to $B$. The line $BQ$ intersects $AD$ in $X$ and $AC$ in $Y$.
Prove that $PDXY$ is cyclic.
