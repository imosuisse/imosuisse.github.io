Let $P$ be a finite set of prime numbers and let $\ell(P)$ be the largest possible number of
consecutive natural numbers such that each of these numbers is divisible by at
least one prime number from $P$. Prove the inequality $\ell(P) \geq |P|$ and show that
equality holds if and only if the smallest element of $P$ is greater than $|P|$.
