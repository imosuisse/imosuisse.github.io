Let $k$ be the incircle of triangle $ABC$ with center $I$.
The circle $k$ touches the sides $BC$,$CA$ and $AB$ at the points $D,E$ and $F$ respectively.
Let $G$ be the intersection point of the segment $AI$ with the circle $k$.
We assume that the lines $BE$ and $FG$ are parallel. Prove that $BD=EF$.
