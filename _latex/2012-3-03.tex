The circles $k_1$ and $k_2$ intersect at the points $D$ and $P$. 
The common tangent to the two circles on the side of $D$ touches $k_1$ in $A$ and $k_2$ in $B$.
The line $AD$ intersects $k_2$ a second time in $C$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the chord $BC$.
Show that $\angle DPM = \angle BDC$ holds.
