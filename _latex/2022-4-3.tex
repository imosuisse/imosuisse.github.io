A hunter and a rabbit are playing the following game on the cells of an infinite square grid.
First, the hunter fixes a colouring of the cells using finitely many colours.
After that, the rabbit secretly chooses a cell to start in.
Each turn, the rabbit reports the colour of its current cell to the hunter and then
secretly moves to an adjacent cell (sharing an edge) that has not been visited before.
The hunter wins if at any point of the game either:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They can determine with certainty the current cell the rabbit is in.
    \item The rabbit cannot make a legal move.
\end{itemize}
Determine if the hunter has a winning strategy.
