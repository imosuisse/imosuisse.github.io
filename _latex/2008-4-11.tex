Let $A=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$ be a sequence of integers. The \emph{successor} of $A$ is
the sequence $A‘=(a’_1,a‘_2,\ldots,a’_n)$ with 
$$a'_k = |\{i<k \mid a_i<a_k\}|-|\{i>k \mid a_i>a_k\}|.$$
Let $A_0$ be a finite sequence of integers and for $k \geq 0$ let $A_{k+1}=A'_k$ be
the successor of $A_k$. Show that a natural number $m$ exists with $A_m=A_{m+1}$.
