Let $ABC$ be an isosceles triangle with $|AC|=|BC|$ with incircle $I$.
Let $P$ be a point on the circumcircle of the triangle $AIB$ which lies within the triangle $ABC$.
The lines through $P$, parallel to $CA$ and $CB$, intersect $AB$ at $D$ and $E$ respectively.
The line parallel to $AB$ through $P$ intersects $CA$ and $CB$ at $F$ and $G$ respectively.
Show that the two lines $DF$ and $EG$ intersect on the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$.
