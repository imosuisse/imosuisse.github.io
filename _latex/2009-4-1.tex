Let $GERMANYISHOT$ be a regular dodecagon. The lines $GN$ and $MI$ intersect at point $P$. Prove that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] the circumcircle of triangle $GIP$ is the same size as the circumcircle of
	$GERMANYISHOT$.
    \item[b)] the distance $PA$ is the same length as one side of $GERMANYISHOT$.
\end{enumerate}
