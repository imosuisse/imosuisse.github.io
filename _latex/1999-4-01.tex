Two circles intersect at the two points $M$ and $N$. Let $A$ be another point on the circle,
different from $M$ and $N$. The straight lines $AM$ and $AN$ intersect the second
circle again at the points points $B$ and $C$.
Show that the tangent to the first circle at point $A$ is parallel to the line $BC$.
