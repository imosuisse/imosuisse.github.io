Consider a board with odd side lengths that is divided into unit squares.
The board without a corner square is somehow covered with dominoes.
You can now move a domino lengthwise by one in one move, such that the previously empty square
is covered, but a new one (two squares away from it) becomes free.
Prove that the empty square can be moved to any corner of the board in a sequence of moves.

\emph{Remark:} A domino consists of two unit squares with a common side.
