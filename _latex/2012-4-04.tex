In the triangle $ABC$ let $\angle BAC = 60^\circ$. Let $E$ be a point on the line $AB$ such
that $B$ lies between $A$ and $E$ and $BE = BC$. Similarly, let $F$ be a point on $AC$ such
that $C$ lies between $A$ and $F$ and $CF = BC$. The circumcircle of $ACE$ intersects $EF$ in $K$.
Show that $K$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.
