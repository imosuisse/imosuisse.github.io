Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AB<AC$.
Let $E$ and $F$ be the feet of the altitudes from $B$ and $C$, respectively,
and $M$ the midpoint of the segment $BC$.
The tangent line to the circumcircle of $ABC$ at $A$ intersects the line $BC$ at $P$.
The line parallel to $BC$ through $A$ intersects the line $EF$ at $Q$.
Prove that the line $PQ$ is perpendicular to the line $AM$.
