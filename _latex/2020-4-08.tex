Let $I$ be the incenter of a non-isosceles triangle $ABC$.
Let $F$ be the intersection of the perpendicular to $AI$ through $I$ with $BC$.
Let $M$ be the point on the circumcircle of $ABC$ such that $MB=MC$
and such that $M$ is on the same side of the line $BC$ as $A$.
Let $N$ be the second intersection of the line $MI$ with the circumcircle of $BIC$.
Prove that $FN$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $BIC$.
