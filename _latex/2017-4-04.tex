Let $k$ be a circle and let $AB$ be a chord of $k$ not containing the center of $k$.
Let $C$ be a point on $k$, different from $A$ and $B$.
For each choice of $C$, let $P_C$ and $Q_C$ be the projections of $A$ onto $BC$ and
$B$ onto $AC$ respectively.
Further, let $O_C$ be the circumcircle of $P_{C}Q_{C}C$.
Show that there is a circle $\omega$ such that $O_C$ lies on $\omega$ for any choice of $C$.
