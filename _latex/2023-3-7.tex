In the acute triangle $ABC$, the point $F$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$,
and $P$ is a point on the segment $AF$.
The lines through $P$ parallel to $AC$ and $AB$ meet $BC$ at $D$ and $E$ respectively.
Points $X \neq A$ and $Y \neq A$ lie on the circumcircles of triangles $ABD$ and $ACE$ respectively,
such that $DA=DX$ and $EA=EY$.  
Prove that $BCXY$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
