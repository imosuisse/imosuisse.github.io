Let $\omega_1$ be a circle with diameter $JK$.
Let $t$ be the tangent to $\omega_1$ at $J$ and let $U \neq J$ be another point on $t$.
Let $\omega_2$ be the smaller circle centred at $U$ that touches $\omega_1$ at one single point $Y$.
Let $I$ be the second intersection of $JK$ with the circumcircle of triangle $JYU$ and
let $F$ be the second intersection of $KY$ with $\omega_2$.
Show that $ FUJI $ is a rectangle.
