Let $m$ be a positive integer greater than $1$. The sequence $x_0, x_1, x_2,\ldots$ is defined by
$$x_i= \begin{cases}
2^i,&\text{for } 0 \leq i \leq m-1\\
\sum_{j=1}^{m}x_{i-j},& \text{for } i \geq m.
\end{cases}$$
Find the largest $k$ such that there exist $k$ consecutive
elements in the sequence that are all divisible by $m$.
