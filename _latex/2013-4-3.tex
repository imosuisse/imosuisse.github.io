Let $n$ be a natural number. Find the largest number $m$ that satisfies the following property:
Let $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ be a sequence of real numbers. Denote by $a$ the maximum length of a
monotonically increasing subsequence of $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ and by $b$ the maximum length of
a monotonically decreasing subsequence of $x_1,\ldots, x_n$. Then $a \cdot b \ge m$.

\emph{Comment:} A monotonically increasing (decreasing) subsequence of $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ is a
sequence of the form $x_{i_1} \le \dots \le x_{i_k}$ ($x_{i_1} \ge \dots \ge x_{i_k}$) with
$1 \le i_1<i_2<\dots <i_k \le n$.
