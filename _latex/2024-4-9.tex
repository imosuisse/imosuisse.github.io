Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with orthocenter $H$, satisfying $AC > AB > BC$.
The perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $AB$ intersect line $BC$ at $R$ and $S$ respectively.
Let $P$ and $Q$ be points on lines $AC$ and $AB$ respectively, both different from $A$,
such that $AB = BP$ and $AC = CQ$.
Prove that the distances from point $H$ to lines $SP$ and $RQ$ are equal.
