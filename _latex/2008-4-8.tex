Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $D$ a point on the segment $BC$.
Let $X$ be another point on the segment $BC$ different from $D$ and let $Y$ be the intersection
of $AX$ with the circumcircle of $ABC$. Let $P$ be the second point of intersection of
the circumcircles of $ABC$ and $DXY$. Prove that $P$ is independent of the choice of $X$.
