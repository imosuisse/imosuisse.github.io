Let $n>1$ be an odd natural number. The squares of an $n \times n$ chessboard are coloured
in alternating white and black, such that the four corner squares are black.
An L-triomino is an L-shaped piece that covers exactly three squares of the board.
For which values of $n$ is it possible to cover all black squares with L-triominoes such that no
two L-triominoes overlap?
Determine the smallest possible number of L-triominos required for these values of $n$.
