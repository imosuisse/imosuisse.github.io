Determine all infinite sequences $a_1, a_2, \dots$ of positive integers such that, for any integer $n\geq 2$,
both the arithmetic and geometric mean of any $n$ consecutive terms of the sequence are integers.
\emph{Remark:} Integers $x_1,\dots, x_k > 0$ have arithmetic mean $\frac{x_1+\cdots+x_k}{k}$ and
geometric mean $\sqrt[k]{x_1\cdots x_k}$.
