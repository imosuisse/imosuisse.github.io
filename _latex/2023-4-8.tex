Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AC>AB$, let $O$ be its circumcentre,
and let $D$ be a point on the segment $BC$.
The line through $D$ perpendicular to $BC$ intersects the lines $AO$,
$AC$ and $AB$ at $W$, $X$ and $Y$, respectively.
The circumcircles of triangles $AXY$ and $ABC$ intersect again at $Z\neq A$.
Prove that if $OW=OD$, then the line $DZ$ is tangent to the circle $AXY$.
