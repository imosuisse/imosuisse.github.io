Let $k$ be a circle with centre $O$.
Let $AB$ be a chord of this circle with midpoint $M \neq O$.
The tangents of $k$ at the points $A$ and $B$ intersect at $T$.
A line goes through $T$ and intersects $k$ in $C$ and $D$ with $CT < DT$ and $BC = BM$.
Prove that the circumcentre of the triangle $ADM$ is the reflection of $O$ across the line $AD$.
