Let $k_1$ be a circle centred at $M$ and $\ell$ a line tangent to $k_1$ at $A$.
Let $k_2$ be a circle inside $k_1$ also tangent to $\ell$ at $A$.
Let $P$ be a point on $\ell$ different from $A$.
The second tangent to $k_1$ through $P$ touches $k_1$ at $T$.
Let $B$ be the second intersection of $AT$ and $k_2$, and let $C$ be the second intersection of $PB$ and $k_2$.
Show that $ATCM$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
