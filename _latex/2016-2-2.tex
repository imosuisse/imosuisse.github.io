Quirin has $n$ blocks, with height $1$ to $n$, and he wants to place them in a line in such a way that his cat can go through them from left to right. The cat can jump from one block to the next one if either the block from which it jumps is higher, or if the difference in height is at most $1$. At the beginning his cat is on the leftmost block. In how many ways can Quirin place his blocks in such a line?

\emph{Remark:} For $n=5$, $3-4-5-1-2$ is possible, but $1-3-4-5-2$ is not.
