A circle $k_1$ is contained in another circle $k_2$ touching it in the point $A$.
A line passing through $A$ intersects $k_1$ again in $B$ and $k_2$ in $C$.
The tangent to $k_1$ at $B$ intersects $k_2$ in the points $D$ and $E$.
The tangents to $k_1$ through $C$ touch $k_1$ in the points $F$ and $G$.
Prove that $D,E,F$ and $G$ lie on a circle.
