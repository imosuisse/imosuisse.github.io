Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle BAC=60^\circ$.
Let $E$ be the point on the side $BC$ such that $2 \angle BAE=\angle ACB$.
Let $D$ be the second intersection of $AB$ with the circumcircle of $AEC$ and let $P$ be the second
intersection of $CD$ with the circumcircle of $DBE$.
Determine the angle $\angle BAP$.
