Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with $CD<AD$ and $CD<BC$.
The diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at the point $S$.
Let the reflection of the line $AB$ at $AC$ be $e$ and the reflection of the
line $AB$ at $BD$ be $f$. The line $CD$ intersects $e$ and $f$ at
the points $E$ and $F$ respectively. Prove that the triangle $SEF$ is isosceles.
