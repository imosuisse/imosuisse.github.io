Let $ABC$ be a triangle in which $\alpha=\angle BAC$ is the smallest angle (strictly).
Let $P$ be a point on side $BC$ and $D$ a point on line $AB$ such that $B$ lies
between $A$ and $D$ and $\angle BPD=\alpha$. Similarly, let $E$ be a point on the
line $AC$ such that $C$ lies between $A$ and $E$ and $\angle EPC=\alpha$.
Show that the lines $AP$, $BE$ and $CD$ are concurrent if and only if $AP$ is perpendicular to $BC$.
