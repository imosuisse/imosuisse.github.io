Let $n$ be a positive integer.
Kimiko starts with $n$ piles of pebbles each containing a single pebble.
She can take an equal number of pebbles from two existing piles and
combine the removed pebbles to create a new pile.
Determine, in terms of $n$, the smallest number of nonempty piles Kimiko can end up with.
