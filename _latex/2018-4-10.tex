Let $ABC$ be a triangle,
$M$ the midpoint of $BC$ and $D$ a point on the line $AB$ such that $B$ lies between $A$ and $D$.
Let $E$ be a point such that $E$ and $B$ are on different sides with respect to the line $CD$
and such that $\angle EDC = \angle ACB$ and $\angle DCE = \angle BAC$.
Let $F$ be the intersection point of $CE$ with the parallel line to $DE$ through $A$.
Let $Z$ be the intersection point of $AE$ and $DF$.
Prove that the lines $AC$, $BF$ and $MZ$ intersect in a point.
