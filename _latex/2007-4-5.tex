Let $n>1$ and $m$ be natural numbers.
A parliament consists of $mn$ deputies who have formed $2n$ commissions, so that
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each committee consists of $m$ deputies.
    \item Each deputy is a member of exactly $2$ commissions.
    \item Two committees have at most one member in common.
\end{itemize}
Determine the largest possible value of $m$ as a function of $n$ so that this is possible.
