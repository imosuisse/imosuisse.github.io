Let $n > 6$ be a perfect number.
Let $p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdot \ldots\cdot p_k^{a_k}$ be the prime factorisation of $n$ where
we assume that $p_1 < p_2<\ldots<p_k$ and $a_i>0$ for all $i=1,\ldots, k$.
Prove that $a_1$ is even.

\emph{Remark:} An integer $n\geq 2$ is called a \emph{perfect number} if the sum of its positive divisors,
excluding $n$ itself, is equal to $n$.
For example, $6$ is perfect, as its positive divisors are $\{1, 2, 3, 6\}$ and $1+2+3 = 6$.
