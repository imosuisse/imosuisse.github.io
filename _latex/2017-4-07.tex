The Brazilian IMO leader chooses two positive integers $n$ and $k$ with $n>k$ and shares them
with their deputy and one of their contestants. The leader then whispers a binary sequence of length
$n$ to the deputy. The deputy then writes down all binary sequences of length $n$ that differ from
the shared sequence in exactly $k$ position. The contestant then looks at all those sequences and
tries to guess the sequence the leader initially chose. How many times does the contestant have to
guess at least, until they are guaranteed to have been correct at least once.

\emph{Remark:} A binary sequence is a sequence consisting of $0$s and $1$s.
Example for $n=3$ and $k=1$: If the leader chooses $101$,
the deputy writes down $001$, $100$ and $111$.
