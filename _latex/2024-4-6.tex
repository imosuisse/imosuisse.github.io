Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer.
Kaloyan has a $1 \times n^2$ strip of unit squares,
where the $i$-th square is labelled with $i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n^2$.
He cuts the strip into several pieces, each piece consisting of a number of consecutive unit squares.
He then places the pieces, without rotation or reflection,
on an $n \times n$ square such that the square is covered entirely and
the unit square in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column contains a number congruent to $i + j$ modulo $n$. 
Determine the smallest number of pieces for which this is possible.
