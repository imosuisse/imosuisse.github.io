For a positive integer $n$ let
$$f(n)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor.$$
Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ for which the
inequality $f(m)<f(m+1)$ holds, and that there are infinitely many positive
integers $m$ for which the inequality $f(m)>f(m+1)$ holds.
