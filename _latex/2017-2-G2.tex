Let $ABC$ be a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse $AB$. A circle with center $C$ intersects the segment $AB$ twice at the points $P$ and $Q$ such that $P$ lies between $A$ and $Q$. Let $R$ be the point on the segment $BC$ with $\angle RAC = \frac{1}{2}\angle PCQ$ and let $S$ be the point on the segment $AC$ with $\angle CBS = \frac{1}{2}\angle PCQ$. Further let $T$ be the intersection of the lines $CP$ and $AR$, and $U$ be the intersection of the lines $CQ$ and $BS$. Show that $RSTU$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
