The $n$ participants of the Olympiad are trying to escape Wonderland.
They arrive at a row of $n$ closed doors, ordered in decreasing size.
For every $1\leq k\leq n$, there is exactly one participant that fits through the first $k$ doors,
but not the others.
One by one, in some order, the participants approach the row of doors to pass through it.
Each participant walks along the row of doors, starting at the largest one.
If they come across an open door they fit through, they walk through it and close it behind them.
If they reach the last door they fit through and it is closed, they open it and go through it,
leaving it open behind them.
If at the end all doors are closed again, all the participants can escape safely.
In how many different orders can the $n$ participants approach the row of doors while achieving this?
