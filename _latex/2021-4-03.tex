Let $p$ be an odd prime.
Arnaud has hung up $N\geq 1$ towels to dry on a washing line, each coloured either purple or yellow.
Then, for each $1 \leq n \leq N$, he calculates what fraction of the first $n$ towels are yellow,
and writes down these $N$ fractions in their irreducible form on a piece of paper.
Julia finds the piece of paper the next day and notices that all of the
fractions $\frac{1}{p}, \frac{2}{p}, \dots, \frac{p-1}{p}$ are on the paper.
Prove that 
$$N \geq \frac{p^3-p}{4}.$$
