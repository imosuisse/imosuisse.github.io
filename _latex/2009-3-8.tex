A floor plan is given which is composed of $n$ unit squares.
Albert and Berta want to cover this floor with tiles,
whereby all tiles have the shape of a $1\times 2$ domino or a T-tetromino.
Albert only has tiles of one colour available, whereas Berta has dominoes in two colours
and tetrominoes in four colours. Albert can cover this floor plan with tiles in $a$ ways,
Berta in $b$ ways. Assuming that $a\neq 0$ applies, determine the ratio $b/a$.
