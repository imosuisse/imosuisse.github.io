Let $ABCD$ be a trapezoid with $AB \parallel CD$ and $AB > CD$.
The points $K$ and $L$ lie on the sides $AB$ and $CD$ respectively with $AK/KB = DL/LC$.
The points $P$ and $Q$ lie on the line $KL$ such that
$$\angle APB = \angle BCD \qquad \text{and} \qquad \angle CQD = \angle ABC.$$
Show that the points $P,Q,B$ and $C$ lie on a circle.
