During the World Cup, there are $n$ different Panini stickers to collect.
Marco's friends are trying to complete their collection, but nobody has a full set of stickers yet!
A pair of his friends are said to be \emph{wholesome} if
their combined collection has at least one of each sticker.
Marco knows the contents of everyone's collections,
and wants to take them all to a restaurant for his birthday.
However, he doesn't want any wholesome pairs sitting at the same table. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] Show that Marco might need to reserve at least $n$ different tables.
    \item[b)] Show that $n$ tables will always be enough for Marco to achieve his goal.
\end{enumerate}
