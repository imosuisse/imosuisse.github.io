Two circles $k_1,k_2$ with midpoints $M_1$ and $M_2$ intersect at points $A$ and $B$.
The tangent to $k_1$ through $A$ intersects $k_2$ once more at point $P$,
while the line $M_1B$ intersects $k_2$ once more at point $Q$.
Assume that $Q$ lies outside $k_1$ and that $P\neq Q$ applies.
Show that $PQ$ is parallel to $M_1M_2$.
