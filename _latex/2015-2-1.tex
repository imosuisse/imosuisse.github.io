On SMO Street there are $n$ houses with house numbers $1$ to $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.
The houses with odd numbers are on the left-hand side of the street, the houses with even numbers on the right.
The postman Quirin wants to deliver a newspaper to each house.
How many ways does he have to do this if he wants to change sides of the street after every newspaper he delivers?
