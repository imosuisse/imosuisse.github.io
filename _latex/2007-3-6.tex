Three circles of the same size $k_1,k_2,k_3$ intersect non-tangentially at a point $P$.
Let $A$ and $B$ be the centres of the circles $k_1$ and $k_2$.
Let $D$ and $C$ be the point of intersection of $k_3$ with $k_1$ and $k_2$,
respectively, which is different from $P$. Show that $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.
