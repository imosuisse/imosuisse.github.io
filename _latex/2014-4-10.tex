A $7\times 7$ square is divided into $49$ $1\times 1$ squares.
Two beetles walk along the sides of the small squares, so that each beetle follows its
own closed path and passes exactly once through each of the $64$ vertices of the small squares.
What is the minimum number of sides of the small squares that have been traversed by both beetles?
