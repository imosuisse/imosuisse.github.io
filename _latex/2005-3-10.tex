Teams of $n>10$ take part in a football tournament.
Each team plays against every other team exactly once. A win results in two points,
a draw in one point and a loss in no points. After the tournament,
it turns out that each team has won exactly half of its points in the games against the $10$
worst teams (in particular, each of these $10$ teams has scored half of its points against
the $9$ remaining teams).
Determine all possible values of $n$ and give an example of such a tournament for these values.
