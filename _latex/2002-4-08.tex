In a group of $n$ people, someone organises a party every weekend for all their friends.
After the party, each pair of attendees becomes friends.
After each of the $n$ people has had a party once,
there are still two people among them who don't know each other.
Show that these two will never meet at one of these parties in the future.
\emph{Remark:} Two people are always either friends or not friends.
