Let $A$ be a point and $k$ a circle through $A$.
Let $B$ and $C$ be two other points on $k$.
Let now $X$ be the intersection of the angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ with $k$.
Further, let $Y$ be the reflection of $A$ in point $X$, and $D$ be the intersection of the line $YC$ and $k$.
Show that the point $D$ does not depend on the choice of the points $B$ and $C$ on the circle $k$.
