Let $n \geq 2$ be a natural number. There is a watchtower in the centre of a circular garden.
At the edge of the garden are $n$ evenly distributed garden gnomes. Attentive guards live on the watchtower.
Each guard monitors an area of the garden that is bordered by two different garden gnomes.
We say that guard $A$ controls guard $B$ if the entire area of $B$ is included in that of $A$.
There are two groups of guards: Apprentices and Masters.
Each apprentice is controlled by exactly one master and does not control anyone,
while masters are not controlled by anyone. The whole garden has maintenance costs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An apprentice costs $1$ gold piece per year.
    \item A master costs $2$ gold pieces per year.
    \item A garden gnome costs $2$ gold pieces per year.
\end{itemize}
Show that the garden gnomes cost at least as much as the guards.
