Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Omega$,
and $k$ be a circle passing through $B$ and $C$ such that $A$ is in the interior of $k$.
The tangent to $\Omega$ through $A$ intersects $k$ at two points $P$ and $Q$,
such that $P$ and $C$ are on different sides of $AB$.
If $M$ is the intersection of $AB$ and $PC$ and $N$ is the intersection of $AC$ and $QB$,
prove that $MN$ is parallel to $PQ$.
