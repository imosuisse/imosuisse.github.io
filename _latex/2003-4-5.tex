There are $n$ pieces on a board with $5 \times 9$ squares,
with a maximum of one piece on each square at any time.
A move consists of moving each piece to one of its four neighbouring squares (up, down, left or right).
This is done simultaneously for all pieces. If a stone is moved horizontally in one turn,
it must be moved vertically in the next turn and vice versa.
Determine the largest value for $n$ so that there is a starting position for the $n$ pieces
and a sequence of moves such that the game can continue indefinitely.
