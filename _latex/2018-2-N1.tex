Let $n\geq 2$ be a positive integer.
Let $d_1, \ldots, d_r$ be all the positive divisors of $n$ that are smaller that $n$.
Determine every $n$ for which
\[
    \operatorname{lcm}(d_1, \ldots, d_r) \neq n.
\]
\emph{Remark:} For $n=18$ we have for instance $d_1 = 1, d_2 = 2, d_3 = 3, d_4 = 6, d_5=9$ and
thus $\operatorname{lcm}(1,2,3,6,9) = 18$.
