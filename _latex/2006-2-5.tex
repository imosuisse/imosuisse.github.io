An $m \times n$-board is divided into unit squares. An L-triomino consists of three unit
squares: a central square and two outer squares. An L-triomino is located in the upper left corner of the board,
the central square covering the corner square of the board. In a move one may rotate the triomino around the
midpoint of one of its outer squares by multiples of $90^\circ$. For which $m$ and $n$ is it possible to move
the triomino to the lower right corner of the board using a finite number of moves?
