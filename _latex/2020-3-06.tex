Let $n\geq 2$ be an integer. Consider the following game:
Initially, $k$ stones are distributed among the $n^2$ squares of an $n\times n$ chessboard.
A move consists of choosing a square containing at least as many stones as
the number of its adjacent squares (two squares are \emph{adjacent} if they share a common edge)
and moving one stone from this square to each of its adjacent squares.
Determine all positive integers $k$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] There is an initial configuration with $k$ stones such that no move is possible.
    \item[b)] There is an initial configuration with $k$ stones such that an infinite sequence 
    of moves is possible.
\end{enumerate}
