Let $AB$ be the diameter of the circle $k$. Let $t$ be the tangent to $k$ at point $B$ and
let $C,D$ be two points on $t$ such that $B$ lies between $C$ and $D$.
The lines $AC$ and $AD$ intersect $k$ again at the points $E$ and $F$.
The lines $DE$ and $CF$ intersect $k$ again at the points $G$ and $H$ respectively.
Prove that the lines $AG$ and $AH$ have the same length
