Let $A$ be an $m \times m$ table, each square containing a number. Let $X_i$ be the set of
entries in the $i$th row and $Y_j$ the set of entries in the $j$th column, $1 \leq i,j \leq m$.
$A$ is called \emph{cool} if the sets $X_1,\ldots,X_m,Y_1,\ldots,Y_m$ are all different.
Determine the smallest value of $n$ such that a cool $2005 \times 2005$ matrix with entries
only from the set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ exists.
