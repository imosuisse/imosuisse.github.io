Let $m, n \geq 2$ be positive integers. We have four colours and want to colour each unit square of a $m \times n$ board with one of them such that in every $2 \times 2$ square all four colours occur. How many different possibilities are there?

\textit{Remark:} We count two possibilities as different if there is at least one square which received different colours.
