Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $D$ a point in its interior. Let $E$ be a point on the
line $AD$ different from $D$. Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be the circumcircles of the
triangles $BDE$ and $CDE$ respectively. $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect the segment $BC$ at
the points $F$ and $G$ respectively. Let the intersection of $DG$ and $AB$ be $X$,
and the intersection of $DF$ and $AC$ be $Y$. Show that $XY$ is parallel to $BC$.
