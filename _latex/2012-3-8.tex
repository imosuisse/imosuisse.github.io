Consider a cube and two of its vertices $A$ and $B$, which are the endpoints of a diagonal.
A \emph{path} is a sequence of cube corners, with each step going from one corner along an edge of the
cube to one of the three neighbouring corners.
Let $a$ be the number of paths of length $2012$ that start in point $A$ and end in $A$ and
let $b$ be the number of paths of length $2012$ that start in $A$ and end in $B$.
Decide which of the two numbers $a$ and $b$ is the larger.
