Let $k$ and $k'$ be two concentric circles with midpoint $O$. Let the circle $k'$ be larger
than the circle $k$. A line through $O$ intersects $k$ at $A$ and $k'$ at $B$, such that $O$ lies
between $A$ and $B$. Another line through $O$ intersects $k$ in $E$ and $k'$ in $F$, such
that $E$ lies between $O$ and $F$. Show that the circumcircle of $OAE$, the circle with
diameter $AB$ and the circle with diameter $EF$ intersect at a point.
