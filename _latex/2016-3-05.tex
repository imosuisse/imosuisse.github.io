Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle ACB = 90^\circ$ and let $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$.
Let $G$ be an arbitrary point on the segment $MC$ and let $P$ be a point on $AG$ for which
$\angle CPA = \angle BAC$. Further, let $Q$ be a point on $BG$ for which $\angle BQC = \angle CBA$.
Show that the circumcircles of triangles $AQG$ and $BPG$ intersect on $AB$.
