In the triangle $ABC$, let $J$ be the center of the excircle that touches the
side $BC$ in $A_1$ and the extensions of the sides $AC$ and $AB$ in $B_1$ and $C_1$ respectively.
The line $A_1B_1$ intersects the line $AB$ at a right angle in $D$.
Let $E$ be the projection of $C_1$ onto the line $DJ$.
Determine the size of the angles $\angle BEA_1$ and $\angle AEB_1$.
