Let $ABCD$ be a square and $M$ a point on the segment $BC$.
The angle bisector of the angle $\angle BAM$ intersects the line $BC$ at point $E$.
Furthermore, the angle bisector of the angle $\angle MAD$ intersects the line $CD$ at the point $F$.
Show that $AM$ and $EF$ are perpendicular to each other.
