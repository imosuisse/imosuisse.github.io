Find all integers $m,n \geq 2$ that fulfill the following two conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $m+1$ is a prime number of the form $4k + 3$ for an integer $k$.
    \item There exists a prime number $p$ and a non-negative integer $a$ with
\[
    \frac{m^{2^n-1}-1}{m-1} = m^n + p^a.
\]
\end{itemize}
