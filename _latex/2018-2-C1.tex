SMO-Land has $1111$ inhabitants. The eleven players of the national football team of Liechtenstein
are distributing autographs to the inhabitants such that everybody gets at most one
autograph from each player (i.e.\ every inhabitant gets from each player either one or zero autograph).
\begin{enumerate}[a)] 
\item How many distinct sets of autographs can be distributed by the players to some given inhabitant?
\item After the distribution, it is noted that no two inhabitants received autographs from the exact same players. Prove that there are two inhabitants who, after putting together all their autographs, have exactly one autograph of each player.
\end{enumerate}
