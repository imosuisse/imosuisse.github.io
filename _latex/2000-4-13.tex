The incircle of the triangle $ABC$ touches the sides $AB$, $BC$ and $CA$ at the points $D$, $E$ and $F$.
Let $P$ be a point in the interior of $ABC$ such that the incircle of $ABP$ also touches the
side $AB$ at $D$. Additionally, let the incircle touch the sides $AP$ and $BP$ at the
points $Q$ and $R$. Show that the four points $E, F, R$ and $Q$ lie on a circle.
