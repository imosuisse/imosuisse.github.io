Let $(a,b)$ be a pair of positive integers.
Henning and Paul are playing a game:
Initially, there are two piles of $a$ and $b$ stones, respectively, on a table.
The pair $(a,b)$ is called the \emph{initial configuration} of the game.
The players proceed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The players alternate and Henning begins.
    \item In each turn, a player either removes a positive number of stones
    from one of the two piles or the same positive number of stones from both piles.
    \item The player who removes the last stone from the table wins the game.
\end{itemize}
Let $A$ be the set of all positive integers $a$ for which there exists
a positive integer $b<a$ such that Paul has a winning strategy for the initial configuration $(a,b)$.
Order the elements of $A$ increasingly as $a_1<a_2<\ldots$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] Prove that the set $A$ is infinite.
    \item[b)] Prove that the sequence $(m_k)_{k \geq 1}$ defined by $m_k := a_{k+1} - a_k$
    for all $k\geq 1$ is not eventually periodic.
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Remark}: A sequence $(x_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is \emph{eventually periodic} if
there exists an integer $k_0\geq 0$ such that the sequence $(x_{k+k_0})_{k\geq 1}$ is periodic.
