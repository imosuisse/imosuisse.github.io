There are $17$ rooks on an ordinary chessboard. Show that you can always choose three rooks,
none of which threaten each other.

\emph{Remark:} A rook can move any number of squares to the left, right,
up or down in one move. A rook threatens another rook if it can move to
the square of the other rook in one move.
