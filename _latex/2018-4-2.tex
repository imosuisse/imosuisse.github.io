Let $O$ be the circumcenter of an acute triangle $ABC$.
The line $OA$ intersects the altitude $h_b$ at $P$ and the altitude $h_c$ at $Q$.
Let $H$ be the orthocenter of $ABC$.
Prove that the circumcenter of $PQH$ lies on the median of $ABC$ through $A$.

\textit{Remark:} The altitude $h_a$ is the line through $A$ perpendicular to $BC$.
