A positive integer $x$ is called \emph{good} if $x$ is the product of an even number of
(not necessarily different) prime numbers. Let $a,b$ be positive integers and define $m(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] Prove that two different positive integers $a,b$ exist such that 
	$$m(1),m(2), \ldots, m(2010)$$
	are all good numbers.
    \item[b)] If $m(x)$ is good for every positive integers $x$, then $a=b$.
\end{enumerate}
