Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram such that $AC=BC$.
A point $P$ is chosen on the extension of the segment $AB$ beyond $B$.
The circumcircle of the triangle $ACD$ meets the segment $PD$ again at $Q$,
and the circumcircle of the triangle $APQ$ meets the segment $PC$ again at $R$.
Prove that the lines $CD$, $AQ$, and $BR$ intersect at one point.
