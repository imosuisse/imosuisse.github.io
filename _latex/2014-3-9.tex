Let the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots $ of integers be defined as follows:
$$a_n = 
\begin{cases}
	0 \text{\,,\, if $n$ has an even number of divisors greater than 2014}\\
	1 \text{\,,\, if $n$ has an odd number of divisors greater than 2014}
\end{cases}$$
Show that the sequence $a_n$ never becomes periodic.
