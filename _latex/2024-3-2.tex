Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$, and let $J$ be the reflection of $I$ with respect to line $BC$.
Let $K$ be the second intersection of line $BC$ with the circumcircle of triangle $CIJ$,
and $L$ be the second intersection of line $BI$ with the circumcircle of triangle $AIK$.
Prove that the lines $BC$ and $JL$ are parallel.
