An integer $m$ is a \emph{true power} if there are positive integers $a$ and $n$ such that $n>1$ and $m=a^n$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] Show that there are $2012$ distinct positive integers such that no non-empty subset of them sums to a real power.
    \item[b)] Show that there are $2012$ distinct positive integers such that every non-empty subset of them sums to a real power.
\end{enumerate}
