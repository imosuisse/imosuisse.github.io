Let $n \geq 1$ be a positive integer. Let a regular $4n$-gon of side length $1$ be
arbitrarily divided into finitely many parallelograms.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] Prove that at least one of the parallelograms in the decomposition is a rectangle.
    \item[b)] Determine the sum of the areas of all rectangles in the decomposition.
\end{enumerate}
