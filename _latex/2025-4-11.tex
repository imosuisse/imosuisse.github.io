Let $\Gamma$ be a fixed circle with two fixed points $A, B$ on it.
For a variable point $P\not\in\{A, B\}$ on $\Gamma$, let $G$ be the center of gravity of the triangle $ABP$.
The parallel to line $GP$ through $B$ intersects $AP$ at point $C$,
and the line $CG$ intersects the circumcircle of the triangle $ABG$ a second time at point $Q$.
Prove that as $P$ varies, the point $Q$ lies on a fixed circle.
