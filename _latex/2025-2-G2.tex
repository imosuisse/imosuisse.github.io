Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AC>BC$.
Its incircle touches sides $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$ at $D$, $E$ and $F$, respectively.
Let $P$ be the point on segment $AC$ such that $BP\parallel DE$.
Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of triangle $AFD$.
Line $EF$ intersects $\Omega$ again at $Q$ and line $PQ$ intersects $\Omega$ again at $R$.
Prove that $PEBR$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
