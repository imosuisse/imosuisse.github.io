Let $n,a,b$ be positive integers with $n \geq 2$.
Aru and Wero are playing a game on a $n\times n$ grid.
At the beginning, there is a single pebble in the bottom-left corner.
A move consists of removing one pebble from some non-empty square $S$ and
performing at least one (possibly both) of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item adding $a$ pebbles to the right neighbour of $S$;
    \item adding $b$ pebbles to the upper neighbour of $S$.
\end{itemize}
Aru starts and they alternate moves.
The first player that cannot make a move loses.
Determine who, if anyone, has a winning strategy in terms of $n, a, b$.
