The Tokyo Metro system is one of the most efficient in the world.
There is some odd positive integer $k$ such that each metro line passes through exactly $k$ stations,
and each station is serviced by exactly $k$ metro lines.
One can get from any station to any other station using only one metro line -- but this connection is unique.
Furthermore, any two metro lines must share exactly one station. 
David is planning an excursion for the IMO team, and wants to visit a set $S$ of $k$ stations.
He remarks that no three of the stations in $S$ are on a common metro line.
Show that there is some station not in $S$, which is connected to every station in $S$ by a different metro line.
