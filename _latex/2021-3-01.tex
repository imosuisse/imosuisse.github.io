Let $(m, n)$ be a pair of positive integers.
Julia has carefully planted $m$ rows of $n$ dandelions in an $m \times n$ array in her back garden.
Now, Jana and Viviane decide to play a game with a lawnmower they just found.
Taking alternating turns and starting with Jana,
they can mow down all the dandelions in a straight horizontal or vertical line
(and they must mow down at least one dandelion!).
The winner is the player who mows down the final dandelion.
Determine all pairs $(m,n)$ for which Jana has a winning strategy.
