Two circles $k_1$ and $k_2$ intersect at points $A$ and $C$. Let $B$ be the second point of intersection of $k_1$ and the tangent line to $k_2$ through $A$, and let $D$ be the second point of intersection of $k_2$ and the tangent line to $k_1$ through $C$. Prove that the lines $AD$ and $BC$ are parallel.
