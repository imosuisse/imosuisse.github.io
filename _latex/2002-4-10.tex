Let $m$ be an arbitrary positive integer.
As a function of $m$, determine the smallest natural number $k$ for which the following applies:
If $\{m, m+1, \ldots , k\} = A \cup B$ is any decomposition into two sets $A$ and $B$,
then $A$ or $B$ contains three elements $a, b, c$ (which do not
necessarily have to be distinct) with $a^{b} = c$.
