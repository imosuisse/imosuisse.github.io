A \emph{palindrome} is a natural number, such that in the decimal system its value is the same,
regardless of whether it is read from the front or from the back (for example $1129211$ or $7337$).
Determine all the pairs $(m,n)$ of natural numbers such that
\[
    (\underbrace{11\dots 11 }_{m})\cdot (\underbrace{11\dots 11}_{n})
\]
is a palindrome.
