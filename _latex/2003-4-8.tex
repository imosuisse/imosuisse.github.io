Let $A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}$ be a triangle and $\omega_1$ a circle that passes through $A_1$ and $A_2$.
Assume that there are circles $\omega_2, \ldots, \omega_7$ with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\omega_k$ passes through the points $A_k$ and $A_{k+1}$ for $k=2,3, \ldots, 7$ where $A_i=A_{i+3}$
    \item $\omega_k$ and $\omega_{k+1}$ touch each other externally for $k=1,2, \ldots, 6$.
\end{itemize}
Show: $\omega_1=\omega_7$.
