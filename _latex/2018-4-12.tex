David and Linus play the following game: 
David chooses a subset $Q$ of $\{1, \dots ,2018\}$.
Then Linus chooses a natural number $a_1$ and computes inductively the numbers
$a_2, \dots, a_{2018}$ with $a_{n+1}$ being the product of all positive divisors of $a_n$.
Let $P$ be the set of integers $k\in\{1,\dots,2018\}$ for which $a_k$ is a perfect square.
Linus wins if $P=Q$. Otherwise David wins.
Determine which player has a winning strategy.
